Life and career
1993–2008: Early life and career beginnings
Ariana Grande-Butera was born in Boca Raton, Florida,[5][6] to Joan Grande, the chief executive officer of Hose-McCann Communications, a telephone and alarm system company,[7][8] and Edward Butera, a graphic design firm owner in Boca Raton.[6][9] Her name was originally inspired by Princess Oriana from Felix the Cat (1959).[10] Grande is of Italian descent.[11] She has an older half-brother, Frankie Grande, who is an actor, dancer and producer,[12] and she is close with her maternal grandmother, Marjorie Grande.[13] Grande's family moved from New York to Florida when her mother was pregnant with Grande, and her parents separated when she was around 8 or 9 years old.[9]
As a child, Grande performed with the Fort Lauderdale Children's Theater,[14] playing her first role as Annie, as well as performing in the musicals, The Wizard of Oz and Beauty and the Beast.[15] At the age of 8, she performed at a karaoke lounge on a cruise ship and with various orchestras such as South Florida's Philharmonic, Florida Sunshine Pops and Symphonic Orchestras, and she made her national television debut singing "The Star-Spangled Banner" for the Florida Panthers.[16] She attended Pine Crest School and North Broward Preparatory School.[17]
By age 13, she became serious about pursuing a music career, though she still concentrated on theater.[18] When she first arrived in Los Angeles to meet with her managers, she expressed a desire to record an R&B album when she was 14: "I was like, 'I want to make an R&B album,' They were like 'Um, that's a helluva goal! Who is going to buy a 14-year-old's R&B album?!'"[9] In 2008, Grande was cast in the supporting role of cheerleader Charlotte in the musical 13 on Broadway,[19] for which she won a National Youth Theatre Association Award.[20] When she joined the musical, Grande left her high school, North Broward Preparatory School, but continued to be enrolled. The school sent materials to her so she could study with tutors.[21] She also sang various times at the New York City jazz club, Birdland.[22]

Grande auditioned for the Nickelodeon television show Victorious in New York along with 13 co-star Elizabeth Gillies in 2009.[23] In this sitcom set in aperforming arts high school, Grande was cast as Cat Valentine.[23] Grande had to dye her hair red every other week for the role because the executive producer, Dan Schneider, did not want all cast members to be brunettes, and the red hair was also a feature that the network felt would fit the personality of Cat.[24] The show premiered in March 2010 to the second largest audience for a live-action series in Nickelodeon history with 5.7 million viewers.[25][26] The role helped propel Grande to teen idol status, but she was more interested in a music career stating that acting is "fun, but music has always been first and foremost with me."[27] Her character was compared to "Brittany Murphy's performance as the hapless Tai in Clueless" (1995) and described as being "very impressionable and easily swayed" but "generally sweet."[28] Season two premiered in April 2011 to 6.2 million viewers, becoming the highest rated episode of Victorious.[29] In 2010, she played the role of Miriam in the musical Cuba Libre, which was written and produced by songwriter Desmond Child.[30]

After the first season of Victorious wrapped, Grande wanted to focus on her music career and began working on her debut album in August 2010.[31] To strengthen her vocal range, she began working with vocal coach Eric Vetro.[32] She made her first musical appearance on the track "Give It Up" on the soundtrack Victorious: Music from the Hit TV Show in August 2011. While filming Victorious, Grande made several recordings of herself singing covers of songs by Adele, Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey, and she uploaded them to YouTube.[33] A friend of Monte Lipman, CEO of Republic Records, came across one of Grande's videos. Impressed by her vocals, he sent the links to Lipman, who signed her to a recording contract.[9] She released her first single, "Put Your Hearts Up", in December 2011, which was recorded for a teen-oriented pop album that was not issued.[34] She later disowned the track for its bubblegum pop sound, saying that she had no interest in recording music of that genre.[34] The song was later certified gold by the RIAA.[35] Also in 2011, she voiced the fairy, Princess Diaspro, in 13 episodes of the Nickelodeon version of the Italian animated television series Winx Club, appeared in Greyson Chance's music video for a song called "Unfriend You" from his album Hold On 'til the Night, portraying Chance's ex-girlfriend, and voiced the title role in the English dub of the Spanish-language animated film Snowflake, the White Gorilla.[36][37]
A second soundtrack, Victorious 2.0, was released on June 5, 2012 as an extended play, featuring Grande in the song "Don't You (Forget About Me)".[38] After three seasons, Victorious was not renewed.[39] The finale aired in February 2013. The third and final Victorious soundtrack, Victorious 3.0, was released on November 6, 2012, featuring Grande in the song "L.A. Boyz".[40] The music video for "L.A. Boyz" features Grande and Victoria Justice performing in front of their cast mates during an episode of Victorious.[41] In December 2012, Grande collaborated on the single version of "Popular Song", a duet with British singer and songwriter Mika.[42] She also starred over the holiday season as Snow White in apantomime-style musical theatre production called A Snow White Christmas, together with Charlene Tilton and Neil Patrick Harris, at the Pasadena Playhouse.[43]
Meanwhile, Nickelodeon created an iCarly and Victorious spin-off starring Jennette McCurdy and Grande.[44] The buddy sitcom, titled Sam & Cat, paired Grande and McCurdy as roommates who form an after-school babysitting business, reprising their respective roles as Cat Valentine from Victorious and Sam Puckett from iCarly.[45] The pilot aired on June 8, 2013, and the show was immediately picked up by the network.[46] The following month, Nickelodeon doubled Sam & Cat's original twenty-episode order for season one, making it a forty-episode season.[47] Despite its success in the ratings, the series was canceled.[48] The final episode aired on July 17, 2014.[49]

Grande released her second studio album My Everything on August 25, 2014, with Rolling Stone magazine writing that "My Everything is where the 21-year-old Nickelodeon starlet grows up. It's a confident, intelligent, brazen pop statement, mixing bubblegum diva vocals with EDM break beats".[83] It sold 169,000 copies in its first week and debuted atop the Billboard 200, becoming her second consecutive No. 1 album in the US.[84] Its lead single, "Problem", features Australian rapper Iggy Azalea and premiered at the 2014 Radio Disney Music Awards on April 27.[85][86] The song debuted at No. 3 (eventually climbing to No. 2) on the Billboard Hot 100, and debuted at No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart, becoming Grande's first No. 1 single in the United Kingdom.[87] It made British chart history as the first song to land at No. 1 based on sales and streams.[87] The song was noted for being the highest debut ever for a collaboration of female soloists.[88] The second single, "Break Free", featuring German musician and producer Zedd,[89] peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 and No. 1 on the Hot Dance/Electronic Songs.[90] As of September 2016, the futuristic video had been viewed more than 700 million times.[91] She performed the song at the opening of the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards, while winning Best Pop Video for her single "Problem".[92] As of May 2016, that video had been viewed more than 800 million times.[93] She also provided guest vocals on "Bang Bang" with Jessie J and Nicki Minaj, the lead single from Jessie J's third studio album Sweet Talker (2014).[94] The song reached No. 3 in the US, Grande's third song in the Hot 100's top 10 the same week ("Problem", "Break Free" and "Bang Bang"),[90] and went to No.1 in the UK. She joined Adele as the only female artist with three top 10 hits simultaneously as a lead artist.[90] The music video for "Bang Bang" has been viewed more than 700 million times on YouTube.[95] Billboard's review noted that My Everything is not kid-friendly, like Grande's earlier efforts, and stated:
[S]he has pulled more sounds into her repertoire while keeping her biggest weapon, a remarkable vocal range, as a steady foundation. ... My Everything is a less cohesive project thanYours Truly, although its best moments eclipse the highs of Grande's 2013 debut. The singles "Problem" and "Break Free" remain dizzying dance tunes, and back-to-back solo songs "One Last Time" and "Why Try" possess the types of flawless melodies that are typically reserved for the world's biggest pop divas. The back half of the album's many collaborations are hit-or-miss.[96]
On September 27, 2014, Grande was the musical performer on the season 40 premiere of NBC's Saturday Night Live, with Chris Pratt hosting.[97] Three days later, the third single from My Everything, "Love Me Harder", featuring Canadian recording artist The Weeknd, debuted on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at No. 7.[98] In November 2014, Grande was featured in Major Lazer's song "All My Love" which was released as the fourth single from the soundtrack album for the film The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1.[99] The same month, Grande released a Christmas song titled "Santa Tell Me".[100] Spending 34 consecutive weeks in the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 in 2014,[101] Grande had the most top 10 singles of any artist that year.[102] She later released a fifth single from My Everything, "One Last Time", which peaked at No. 13 on the Billboard Hot 100. By April 2015, the album had sold over 600,000 copies in the US[103] and is certified double platinum by the RIAA.[59]
2015–present: The Honeymoon Tour and Dangerous Woman
In early 2015, Grande embarked on The Honeymoon Tour of North America and Europe, with several later stops in Asia and South America.[104] The tour earned $14 million in its first 25 performances, selling 290,699 tickets.[105] Following the tour's early success, more dates were added,[106] and the tour concluded in October 2015 after a total of nearly 90 dates.[107] Reviews of the tour performances generally praised Grande's vocals and ability to convey emotion in the songs but found the concerts to be over-produced: "[S]ome judicious editing would've elevated the evening from surprising to satisfying and possibly even shockingly good. As it is, Grande is so busy piling on the spectacle she neglects to highlight the one thing – those deceptively powerful pipes – setting her apart from her contemporaries."[108] Grande was featured on Cashmere Cat's song "Adore", which was released in March during her Honeymoon Tour; a review in USA Today said: "Grande's towering vocals have never sounded better than on this offbeat R&B track."[109]

Artistry
Musical style and influences

Mariah Carey, one of Grande's vocal influences
Grande's music is generally pop and R&B, and it has elements of funk, dance and hip hop.[51][193] Grande said she grew up mainly listening to urban pop and 90s music.[193][194] Grande said of her debut album, Yours Truly (2013), that "half of it is a throwback and like very familiar feeling, feel good, and then half of it is something that I've created that's sort of special and unique and refreshing".[195] The doo-wop-inspired disc was complimented for recreating the R&B "vibe and feel of the 90s" with the help of nineties R&B hit maker Babyface.[196] The follow-up, My Everything (2014), has been described as an evolution from her first album with a new sound exploring EDM and electropop genres.[83] The Los Angeles Times review of her third album, Dangerous Woman, commented that it is "impressive how fully she inhabits the emotional environment of each song here, even when one directly contradicts another. ... She's ... deft [at] adapting to different styles".[197]
"I love Mariah Carey. She is literally my favorite human being on the planet. And of course Whitney [Houston] as well. As far as vocal influences go, Whitney and Mariah pretty much cover it. I love Fergie as well. She's just so fun and passionate. I love that she raps as well. Like, she has a fantastic voice and she can belt Gs and As and she doesn't have to do it all the time. She just has swag and I think that's really cool."

Grande has cited Cuban-American star Gloria Estefan as the person who inspired her to pursue a career in the music industry, after Estefan complimented a performance she saw Grande give on a cruise ship when she was eight years old.[199] Grande cites Whitney Houston as a major influence on her career, stating that Houston has inspired her "endlessly" since she was a child.[200] Grande also described Houston as the reason why she began singing, as well as citing Brandy Norwood as an influence, noting her "riffs" in particular.[201]
She has also cited Madonna, Destiny's Child, Fergie, Christina Aguilera, India.Arie, Imogen Heap and Amy Winehouse as influences.[194][198][202][203] Grande's debut album was inspired by artists like Amy Winehouse, Mariah Carey, Whitney Houston, Alicia Keys, Christina Aguilera, Katy Perry and Madonna, with unreleased collaborations with SkyBlu ofLMFAO, 3OH!3, Kool Kojak and Pebe Sebert.[204][205][206] She named Keys, Carey and Beyoncé as female artists she tried to channel during the three years it took to create the record.[207] Grande described Imogen Heap as one of her influences, noting Heap's "intricate" song structure. She also cites India.Arie as an influence, calling Arie's voice "heaven" and praising her lyrics.[201] She has described actress and singer Judy Garland as being one of her childhood influences, stating that she grew up watching and listening to Garland, admiring her ability to tell "a story when she sings".[201] Grande has stated that Big Sean, whom she dated from 2014 to 2015, is her favorite rapper and collaborator.[193][208]
Voice
Grande possesses a four-octave and a note soprano vocal range,[209] and the whistle register.[210] With the release of her debut album, Yours Truly (2013), Grande was deemed the "mini Mariah Carey" and the "new Mariah Carey" by some critics because of her wide vocal range, sound and musical material.[211][212][213] Speaking on the comparisons, Julianne Escobedo Shepherd ofBillboard wrote that both Carey and Grande "got the talent to let their vocals do the talking."[214] Shepherd continued, "that's not where the similarities end. ... Grande is subverting it with cute, comfortable, and on-trend dresses with a feminine slant."[214] Grande expressed her feelings towards being compared to Mariah Carey as a "huge compliment" and a "blessing",[202][215] and has cited both Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston as influences for her work.[194][198] She said: "[I]t's a huge compliment, but when you hear my entire album, you'll see that Mariah's sound is much different than mine."[202] Steven J. Horowitz of Billboard said in 2014 that it was time to stop comparing Grande to Carey stating, "With her sophomore album, the "Problem" singer no longer resembles the elusive chanteuse – and that's okay."[213]
Her vocal display at the 2013 American Music Awards, earned praise from celebrities like Kelly Clarkson and Lady Gaga, which saw Grande singing a cappella to her hit "The Way" and a Motown-style performance of "Tattooed Heart."[216] During an interview with Sirius XM, American pop singer Katy Perry praised Grande, saying she has "the best female vocal in pop music today. She has literally ... the best voice live."[217][218] In an interview with Ryan Seacrest, Coldplay's frontman Chris Martin was asked if a duet with her was a possibility, to which he responded: "I would man, but she can sing so much better than me. I don’t want to be humiliated in that fashion, I was in the car yesterday and "Problem" was on, I was like, 'I just can’t do that.'"[219] In 2016, composer and playwright Jason Robert Brown addressed Grande in Time magazine:
[N]o matter how much you are underestimated ... you are going to open your mouth and that unbelievable sound is going to come out. That extraordinary, versatile, limitless instrument that allows you to shut down every objection and every obstacle. That voice – powered by nothing but your remarkable empathy, your ravenous intelligence, your cool discipline and your voracious ambition.[3]
Public image

Grande's modest look early in her career was described as "age appropriate", compared with other pop stars who grew up in the public eye.[214] Jim Farber of New York Daily News wrote in 2014 that Grande received less attention "for how little she wears or how graphically she moves than for how she sings."[220] By 2014, however, she opted to wear short skirts and crop tops with knee-high boots in performances and on red carpets.[221] After years of dying her hair red to play Cat Valentine, Grande wore extensions while her natural hair grew out.[24] In 2015, she reported with apparent relief that her natural "healthy curls" were back,[222]although she continued generally to wear it straightened in her familiar half-ponytail.[223] Anne T. Donahue of MTV called Grande "aesthetically relevant" and argued that her bold and whimsical fashion choices should receive more critical attention:
Grande's ponytail is ... as famous as her voice and ... a massive component of the pop culture zeitgeist. ... [W]hile pulling off a high ponytail takes courage and commitment, so does her recent [fashion] ode to Marilyn Monroe at the [2016] MTV Movie Awards and her homage to crime-fighting heroes in her 'Dangerous Woman' cover art. ... [S]he's boasted floor-length red gowns, chokers, crop tops, and oversize jackets [and] everything from theater garb (see: flapper dresses) to Mickey Mouse ears to A-line minis. Which, in an industry rich in self-branding, is a beautiful rarity ... deft whimsy. ... So why aren't we giving her credit? ... [D]ismissing Ariana Grande as a fashion force is an easy and lazy way of categorizing her. ... [W]e fail to mention her in the same breath as fellow aesthetically relevant pop stars. [F]ashion is best when it's an extension of self and a wearable form of expression. (Plus, we know that when we see someone take risks, they understand fashion on an intrinsic level...).[224]
Although Grande drew criticism for allegedly impolite interactions with reporters and fans in 2014,[225] she dismissed these reports as "weird, inaccurate depictions".[226] After considering the incidents most frequently mentioned in the press and the available evidence, PopSugar concluded that Grande's was "just normal star behavior" and "not the most ideal situation, but ... not exactly the sign of a diva".[227] Rolling Stone wrote: "Some may cry 'diva', but it's also Grande just taking a stand to not allow others to control her image."[228] She was praised in the press and by female celebrities like Taylor Swift, Rita Ora and Selena Gomez for an "empowering" 2015 essay posted on Twitter decrying the double standard and misogyny in the focus of the press on female musicians' relationships and sex lives, instead of "their value as an individual".[229][230] Grande noted that she has "more to talk about" concerning her music and accomplishments.[231][232] In 2016, E! writer Kendall Fisher called her "a feminist hero" in an essay examining Grande's feminist statements.[233]
In July 2015, Grande was seen on surveillance video in a doughnut shop licking doughnuts that were on display and saying "I hate Americans. I hate America. This is disgusting."[234] She responded to critics, writing that she is "extremely proud to be an American" and that her comments related to American obesity.[235] She later released a video apology for "behaving poorly".[236]The incident was parodied by The Muppets[237] and featured in Miley Cyrus' Saturday Night Live cover of "My Way", about the regrets of the summer of 2015.[238] Grande mocked the incident herself on Saturday Night Live in 2016.[239]
