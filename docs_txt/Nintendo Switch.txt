Suitchi?, known in development as the NX) is an upcoming hybrid video game console developed by Nintendo, and the company's seventh major home console. Officially unveiled in October 2016, it is currently scheduled for release worldwide in March 2017.
The Switch is a tablet-like portable console, which can be inserted into a docking station connected to a television for use as a home console. Despite this characteristic, Nintendo markets the Switch primarily as a home console rather than as a portable. The Switch features two detachable wireless controllers, called Joy-Con controllers, which can be used individually or attached to a grip to provide a traditional gamepad form.

History[edit]
One of Satoru Iwata's last actions as president of Nintendo prior to his death in July 2015 was to push the company towards mobile gaming, forming a business alliance with Japanese mobile provider DeNA in March 2015.[2] Iwata recognized that mobile gaming was a rapidly growing market and wanted to bring Nintendo's intellectual properties to it without compromising their integrity.[3] During a joint press conference on 17 March 2015 to announce this partnership, Nintendo also confirmed that it was developing a new hardware platform codenamed "NX", which it described as having a "brand new concept".[4]
Nintendo stated that the NX would not be a direct replacement of the existing Nintendo 3DS and Wii U product lines, which were launched in 2011 and 2012, respectively. In an interview with the Asahi Shimbun, Nintendo's new president Tatsumi Kimishima stated that the NX would provide a "new way to play" that would "have a larger impact than the Wii U". He believed that the Wii U would "slow" following the release of the NX, but reiterated that the platform will not be a successor or direct replacement of the Wii U.[5][6]
At an investor's meeting on 27 April 2016, Nintendo announced that the NX would be released worldwide in March 2017.[7][8] Nintendo did not unveil the NX's hardware at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in June 2016, though it did announce that The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, which was originally announced as a Wii U exclusive, would be released for both the NX and Wii U. At a Nintendo shareholders' meeting following the conference, Shigeru Miyamoto stated that the company had concerns that competitors could copy ideas from the NX if they revealed it too soon.[9][10]
The following month, rumors began to surface about the nature of the NX, which suggested that it would be a hybrid device designed for both home and portable usage, and would feature detachable controllers. It was also speculated that the platform would utilize a system on a chip from the Nvidia Tegra series, which is designed for use in mobile devices.[11][12] Some of these rumors were supported by patents issued to Nintendo for various game console hardware.[13]
On 20 October 2016, Nintendo released a trailer that officially unveiled the device and its final branding, Nintendo Switch, and confirmed its nature as a hybrid device.[14] Nintendo of Americapresident and COO Reggie Fils-Aimé emphasized the console's appeal as a device that would provide gamers the option to play at home or on the go, and noted that it would enable developers to create new types of games.[15] At the time of the trailer's release, Nintendo did not provide many details on features of the platform, and do not plan to describe specifications until 2017, though did state there are additional features that were not presented in the introductory trailer.[16][17] Nintendo has planned a press event for the Switch on 12 January 2017 in Tokyo where it will reveal the unit's full specifications, retail price, and initial game release lineup.[18] The event will be livestreamed around the world, and various "sampling events" will take place after it.[19]
Nintendo plans to ship 2 million units by the end of March 2017, and anticipates that consumers will be able to try the Switch sometime before its release. Kimishima stated that the Switch will not besold at a loss.[20]
Hardware[edit]
The Nintendo Switch is a hybrid video game console, with the main system comprising the "Switch Console", "Switch Dock" and the "Joy-Con" controllers. Although it is a hybrid console, a Nintendo spokesperson stated that the Switch was "a home gaming system first and foremost", and that it does not affect Nintendo's continued sales of the Nintendo 3DS. Instead, Nintendo will start to diminish production of the Wii U in anticipation of the Switch's release.[21]
Console and dock[edit]
The main unit of the console is the "Switch Console", a battery-powered tablet-like monitor that comprises an LCD screen,[22] a 3.5 mm audio jack and a kickstand.[23][24] The console has slots on the side, into which the Joy-Con controllers can be slid when removed from the base. The unit also includes a slot for a Game Card (cartridge-based media) to be installed or removed.
The console can be placed into the Switch Dock, a docking station that connects to a power supply and to television when it needs to be charged or to transfer the output onto a television.[14] Ars Technica estimated the tablet has a 6.5 in (17 cm) diagonal viewing area, with the unit measuring about 5.8 in × 4.2 in (15 cm × 11 cm) without the Joy-Con controllers attached.[25] According to insider sources speaking Eurogamer but not yet confirmed by Nintendo, the Switch's screen is a 6.2 in (16 cm) capacitive touchscreen with ten-point multitouch detection, comparable to most other smartphones and tablet computers on the market, and offers a 720p resolution. These sources note that the right Joy-Con controller includes an infrared sensor, which would allow the user to still play touch-based games when the Switch is in the dock.[26]
Controllers[edit]
The Nintendo Switch comes with a controller system called the Joy-Con. The system comprises of two controllers; the "L" and "R", and come in the Joy-Con Grip, its specified base frame, and includes action and shoulder buttons, bumper triggers and a joystick on both.[27] The controllers can be attached to the Switch Console (similar to the Wii U GamePad), they can be removed and used separately in each hand (similarly to a Wii Remote and Nunchuk controller), attached to a grip to provide a gamepad form factor or used as individual controllers for two players.
The console will support a wireless gamepad known as the Switch Pro Controller which has a more traditional design reminiscent of the Wii Classic Controller Pro and Wii U Pro Controller.[24][28]The Nintendo Switch will support multiplayer via multiple systems; for example, allowing four players to play using two Switch systems.[14][29]
Accessories[edit]
Though not revealed in the October 2016 reveal, the Nintendo Switch will support a wide array of additional accessories, according to Kimishima. Kimishima suggested that the Switch is part of a large ecosystem of devices though the Switch unit remains the core console element, and that several of these accessories will be revealed in the January 2017 event.[30]
Technical specifications[edit]
Exact specifications have not been officially announced, but Nvidia confirmed that the Switch uses a custom system-on-chip from its Nvidia Tegra family of products. No specific details were revealed beyond that it is "based on the same architecture as the world's top-performing GeForce gaming graphics cards", and has a custom API known as "NVN", which is designed to "bring lightweight, fast gaming to the masses".[14][31]
Games distributed at retail will be stored on cartridges, similar in design to the Game cards used for Nintendo DS and 3DS games.[32] However, the Switch will not be compatible with physical 3DS cards or Wii U optical discs.[33] Like Nintendo's previous consoles and handhelds, such as the Wii U and New Nintendo 3DS (and XL), the Switch will have native compatibility with Amiiboproducts.[23]
Games[edit]
Main article: List of Nintendo Switch games
During its official unveiling in October 2016, Nintendo deliberately opted not to provide a list of games for the system, as they "want people to touch the device in January [2017] and experience the software for themselves", according to Kimishima.[30] Instead, Nintendo announced some of the partners that had committed to supporting the Switch; contrasting Nintendo's struggles to gain third-party support on-launch for previous platforms, the company initially listed 48 third-party publishers, studios, and middleware developers.[14] Among these partners, Nintendo listed major publishers such as Activision, Bethesda, Capcom, Electronic Arts, Sega, Square Enix, and Ubisoft.[14][34][35] Both Unity Technologies and Epic Games also pledged support to help developers bring games using their game engines, Unity and Unreal Engine 4 respectively, to the Switch.[36][37]
Prior to the console's official unveiling, Sega, Square Enix, and Ubisoft had already confirmed specific third-party titles in development for Switch, including Just Dance 2017,[38] Project Sonic 2017,[39] Dragon Quest X,[40] and Dragon Quest XI.[41] Various indie developers also announced or considered game titles for the Switch.[42]
The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, originally announced as a Wii U exclusive, will also be released for the Switch.[9][43][44] While the console's reveal trailer showcased footage from potential new titles in the Super Mario, Mario Kart, and Splatoon series as well as footage from NBA 2K17 and The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim,[45] Nintendo later stated that the footage on the Switch's screen does not necessarily reflect any confirmed titles for the system, and were only selected to demonstrate the Switch's range of functionality.[46] Bethesda, the publisher of Skyrim, affirmed they had no current plans to bring the title to the Switch, but had provided Nintendo the footage to support the reveal as a committed developer for the system.[47] Take-Two, the publisher for NBA 2K17, also affirmed they had no present plans for this title on the Switch.[48]
Reception[edit]
Financial analysts had a mixed response to the announcement of the Nintendo Switch.[16][17] Following the financially under-performing Wii U, analysts had expected that Nintendo would recognize their vulnerable position in the console market when developing their next console, believing that the company would find a means to draw back the core gamer market. Instead, initial promotion of the Switch appeared to appeal to an audience that fell between the core gamer and casual gamer markets, the latter being mobile game players that would want a more engaging experience but would not be willing to play for hours at a time, according to The New York Times.[16] Analysts were unsure if such a market existed in large enough numbers to justify the Switch.[16] Other concerns about the Switch's announcement were related to yet-confirmed details that could make or break the system, such as its retail price, whether the unit includes a touchscreen, the unit's battery life, and the type of games that development partners will bring to the console.[49] The company's stock price, which rose by 4% on the day before the Switch's announcement in anticipation,[49] fell by 7% the next day due to these issues.[16] That said, stock research analyst John Taylor expressed the opinion that Nintendo "checked off an awful lot of boxes with [the Switch]".[15] Taylor also approved of the company's decision to introduce the console prior to the holiday season, when Microsoft and Sony would attempt to attract casual gamers to their consoles.[15] Rob Fahey, writing forGamesIndustry.biz, noted that within Japan, many young adults do not own a high-definition television, which has affects newer console sales such as the PlayStation 4, and the Switch would be an attractive product for this demographic.[50]
Game developers were more positive towards the Switch, seeing the system as "a more unifying experience between their handheld and console divisions", but expressed concern on unanswered hardware specifications, and how Nintendo will market the unit to draw in developers.[42] Following the October 2016 reveal video, Phil Spencer, the head of Xbox, was questioned on Twitter about his thoughts on the Nintendo Switch, and replied saying that he was impressed with Nintendo's ability to "state a bold vision and build a product that delivers on that vision".[51] Xbox's head of games marketing, Aaron Greenberg, congratulated Nintendo, saying he loves "seeing new innovation in our industry".[52] The trailer became Nintendo's most-viewed video on YouTube within 24 hours, and was the top trending video on YouTube for about a day.[53]
Engadget editors were generally impressed with the Switch on reveal, seeing it as a means to bridge home consoles with portable devices, experiments that Nintendo had tried before with inter-game connectivity between the 3DS and Wii U. The editors potentially see the Switch as a unified console and handheld device, aimed to be a console gamer's second device and where the player does not need the time investment to sit down and play most console games. One editor did express concerns on the hardware's durability given its modular nature.[54]
