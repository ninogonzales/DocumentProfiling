Together they struggle to survive and adapt in a post-apocalyptic world filled with walkers and opposing groups of survivors, who are often more dangerous than the walkers themselves.[5]
Much of the series takes place within the Atlanta metro area and surrounding countryside. Later, the setting transitions to other parts of the country including Alexandria, Virginia.[4][6]
The Walking Dead premiered in the United States on October 31, 2010, exclusively shown on cable television channel AMC[7] and internationally onFox International Channels.[8] As a result of very favorable Nielsen ratings that rank the show unprecedentedly high for a cable series, AMC has renewed the series each year. Beginning with its third season, The Walking Dead attracts the most 18- to 49-year-old viewers of any cable or broadcast television series.[9][10][11] It is presently airing its seventh season, which began on October 23, 2016,[12][13] and has been renewed for an eighth season to air in late 2017.[14]
The series has been well received by critics and nominated for several awards, including the Writers Guild of America Award for Television: New Seriesand the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series – Drama.[15][16][17] An AMC companion series, Fear the Walking Dead, debuted on August 23, 2015.[18][19]

Series overview
Main article: List of The Walking Dead episodes
The Walking Dead takes place after the onset of a worldwide zombie apocalypse. The zombies, colloquially referred to as "walkers", shamble towards living humans and other creatures to eat them; humans that they bite or scratch become infected and slowly turn into walkers as well. It is revealed early in the series that all living humans carry this pathogen, so that if they die from any other cause, they will also turn into walkers. The only way to permanently kill a walker is to damage its brain or otherwise destroying the body such as by setting it aflame.
The series centers on sheriff's deputy Rick Grimes, who wakes up from a coma to discover this apocalypse. He becomes the leader of a group of survivors from the Atlanta, Georgia region as they attempt to sustain themselves and protect themselves not only attacks from walkers but from other groups of survivors that are willing to assure their longevity by any means necessary.

Main article: The Walking Dead (season 1)
Rick, while on his sheriff's patrol duty with his partner Shane Walsh, is injured and falls into a coma. He awakens some time after the apocalypse, and meets survivor Morgan Jones, who explains the dangers of walkers. Rick travels to Atlanta, Georgia, in search of his family only to find that the city has been overrun by walkers. Rescued by Glenn Rhee, Rick is eventually introduced to the rest of Glenn's group, who are camping a few miles outside of the city. There, he discovers that his wife Lori and son Carl have been hiding with Shane. The two employ different approaches to keep the peace as Rick returns to Atlanta for supplies and a man left behind, while Shane exerts his authority over the camp. When the camp is overrun by walkers, Rick and Shane convince the surviving group to head for the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta. They briefly shelter with the only remaining CDC staff member, who has been unable to develop a cure, before a protocol incinerates the facility.[21][22]
Season 2 (2011–12)
Main article: The Walking Dead (season 2)
While scavenging supplies along a highway, Carol Peletier's daughter is separated and Carl is accidentally shot, forcing the survivors to stay on the nearby farm of veterinarian Hershel Greene. Hershel saves his life, and in the group's attempt to co-exist with Hershel's family, secrets and disagreements lead to rising tensions. In addition, Rick learns of Lori's former affair with Shane and her newfound pregnancy, creating a rift between Rick and Shane.
A hidden collection of walkers – mainly friends and family of Hershel but also Carol's missing daughter – is discovered in a barn and eventually released by an agitated Shane, who compels the group to eliminate the threat. Shortly thereafter, an encounter with a hostile group of survivors results in a shootout and the torture of a prisoner as they react to the new threat. Shane unilaterally decides to kill the prisoner without the group's knowledge. In an attempt to take over leadership, an unhinged Shane lures Rick away to murder him but is himself killed. The scuffle attracts a horde of walkers who overrun the farm, forcing the group to scatter and regroup. Rick's leadership is questioned but solidified, and he reveals what he learned at the CDC: everyone is infected and will reanimate after death even if they aren't bitten by a walker.[23]
Season 3 (2012–13)
Main article: The Walking Dead (season 3)
After spending several months fleeing remnants of the herd, the survivors make a new home in a prison infested with walkers but find greater danger from the treachery of two rescued convicts. In the process of clearing it, Maggie Greene is forced to perform a fatal Caesarean section on Lori to save her baby, and Rick becomes withdrawn and hallucinates of Lori and others who died. Meanwhile, Andrea and Michonne – who rescued Andrea near Hershel's farm – are discovered by Merle Dixon and taken to the town of Woodbury which is led by a man known as The Governor. Michonne is distrustful and escapes to the prison, where she meets Rick's group and guides them on a rescue mission following Glenn and Maggie's capture. There are casualties on both sides and The Governor, disfigured by Michonne, declares the prison group terrorists and Merle a traitor.
Reunited with his brother, Daryl Dixon briefly leaves the group with Merle before deciding his place is at the prison. Rick returns to his hometown to gather weapons and ammunition, and reconsiders his morality when confronted by an unhinged Morgan. A romantically-involved Andrea convinces The Governor to negotiate a truce with Rick; secretly, The Governor plans an ambush, and Merle thwarts it at the cost of his life. Andrea flees Woodbury but is captured by The Governor, who locks her in a room with a walker and launches a full-scale attack on a seemingly-abandoned prison. They are ambushed by Rick's group, and The Governor massacres his own people for refusing to fight. The Governor escapes, and Rick's group returns to Woodbury to take in the survivors but are too late to save Andrea.[24]
Season 4 (2013–14)
Main article: The Walking Dead (season 4)
Several months have passed and the prison community has grown when a deadly flu-like infection spreads among the population, killing residents, who reanimate as walkers. Carol is banished for murdering two sick residents. Baited walkers breach the prison fence and are barely contained when a scavenging detail returns with medicine. Elsewhere, The Governor encounters the Chambler family, and they join another group of survivors led by The Governor's former right-hand man from Woodbury, Martinez. The Governor murders Martinez and takes charge of the group, honing them into a fighting force he turns on the plague-weakened prison. Rick offers to share the prison, but The Governor ignites hostilities by executing Hershel. The Governor is ultimately killed, but the prison is overrun by walkers and Rick's group is scattered.
Separated into small groups, the survivors discover signs along railway lines advertising sanctuary at Terminus. Glenn and Tara Chambler join with a group of survivors escorting Eugene Porter – who claims to know how to stop the walkers – to Washington, D.C. They reunite with Maggie and are the first to reach Terminus. Carol aids a pair of troubled sisters she secretly taught to use weapons, and after one commits fratricide, she is forced to execute the remaining sister. Beth Greene is kidnapped away from Daryl, and he falls in with a gang that later reveal a vendetta against Rick; Daryl sides with Rick, Carl and Michonne to defeat them, then push on to reach Terminus. Those who arrive are initially welcomed by the residents of Terminus, but ultimately forced to disarm and locked inside a railway boxcar.[25]
Season 5 (2014–15)
Main article: The Walking Dead (season 5)
Rick's group learn the residents of Terminus engage in cannibalism, luring victims to them under the guise of protection. Carol uses walkers to attack Terminus, enabling the others to escape. Reunited, they soon encounter Gareth and a small band of Terminus survivors who attempt to terrorize and prey upon Rick's group but are outmatched and killed. Abraham Ford and Rosita Espinosa continue their mission to get Eugene to Washington, D.C., joined by Glenn, Maggie and Tara. After facing a number of setbacks, Eugene admits that he fabricated the story about a cure in order to receive protection. Meanwhile, Daryl and Carol follow a marked car to Atlanta, where Beth has been held in a nearby hospital ruled by morally-compromised police officers. Carol is taken, and Daryl recruits the rest of his group to help. They capture several police officers to make a trade but a brief standoff ends in Beth's death.
The reunited group continue toward Washington, D.C. and are approached by Aaron, who offers them shelter at the Alexandria Safe Zone, a fortified suburban community led by Deanna Monroe. Feeling the sheltered residents wouldn't be able to survive against walkers or hardened survivors, Rick and Carol consider forcefully taking over the community while others begin assuming leadership roles. A series of confrontations frighten residents, and during a meeting deciding Rick's fate he executes a prominent resident who accidentally killed Deanna's husband. Rick's friend Morgan arrives to witness the execution.[26]
Season 6 (2015–16)
Main article: The Walking Dead (season 6)
Trusting Rick for their survival, Alexandrian volunteers help to lure a nearby horde of walkers away from the community. Others repel an invasion by the deranged Wolves which results in a large herd of walkers breaking off to surround Alexandria. The walls hold for a day before walkers overrun the community, trapping residents indoors. An attempt to escape ends with Carl losing an eye and several deaths, including Deanna's. Rick and Michonne inspire the community to make a stand and are nearly overwhelmed when the walkers are diverted by burning fuel brought by Daryl. Rick, who had been treating the Alexandrians as expendable, admits he was wrong and sees they can go beyond survival to build a stronger community.
Two months later, the community faces a food shortage when they meet Jesus, who invites them to trade with the Hilltop. Offering mercenary services in exchange for food and medicine, Rick leads a team to wipe out a nearby compound of the extortionist Saviors and executes a man claiming to be their leader, Negan. However, the Saviors remain a threat and seek to take prisoners as leverage against Alexandria. Extremist Carol is saved by pacifist Morgan when she flees to resolve her troubled conscience in death. Maggie suffers pregnancy complications and Rick's group attempt to get her to the Hilltop Colony for medical care. Along the way the group find the Saviors have blockaded the main route with debris, forcing them to try another. The group find themselves being trapped and psychologically tormented. Forced to their knees, Rick's group must listen to Negan at gun point, where he determines they should be punished for killing his men.
Season 7 (2016)
Main article: The Walking Dead (season 7)
Negan murders Abraham and Glenn as the group watches in horror. Negan then tests Rick mentally through multiple actions, almost making him cut off Carl's arm, in order to break him. Rick subdues to Negan's wrath and agrees to give him their belongings. The group then continues to the Hilltop.
Season 8
Season 8 was announced in October 2016, just prior to the Season 7 broadcast premiere, to air in late 2017; it will include the series' 100th episode. Gimple is set to remain as the showrunner for this season.[14]
Future seasons
Executive producer David Alpert said in 2014, that the original comics have given them enough ideas for Rick Grimes and company over the next seven years. "I happen to love working from source material, specifically because we have a pretty good idea of what Season 10 is gonna be", Alpert said. "We know where seasons 11 and 12 [will be]... we have benchmarks and milestones for those seasons if we're lucky enough to get there."[27]

Darabont connections
The series features several actors whom Walking Dead developer Frank Darabont has worked with previously, including Laurie Holden (Andrea), Jeffrey DeMunn (Dale Horvath), Melissa McBride (Carol Peletier), Sam Witwer (the dead soldier in the tank where Rick hides in "Days Gone Bye"), and Juan Gabriel Pareja (Morales). All five appeared in his 2007 film The Mist, along with Thomas Jane, who originally was set to star in the series when it was pitched to HBO. Jane was later in talks with Darabont to possibly guest star on the series as of fall 2010,[30] but with Darabont's departure,[31] it is unknown whether the guest spot will happen or not. Laurie Holden also appeared in the 2001 film The Majestic (as Adele Stanton, Jim Carrey's character's love interest), which Darabont directed. DeMunn has also appeared in several of Darabont's films; in addition to The Mist and The Majestic, he appeared in The Shawshank Redemption (1994) and The Green Mile(1999). It was planned that Witwer (Private Jessup in Darabont's The Mist) would reprise his "Days Gone Bye" role in the original conception of The Walking Dead's season two premiere[32] and in a webisode,[33] but both plans were discarded.[34]
Production
Development

The Walking Dead creator Robert Kirkman is also an executive producer and writer of the TV series.
On January 20, 2010, AMC officially announced that it had ordered a pilot for a possible series adapted from The Walking Dead comic book series, with Frank Darabont and Gale Anne Hurd acting as executive producers and Darabont writing and directing.[35] The entire series was pre-ordered based just on the strength of the source material, the television scripts, and Darabont's involvement.[36] In January 2010 a review of the pilot episode's script attracted further attention.[37] The pilot began filming in Atlanta, Georgia on May 15, 2010[38] after AMC had officially ordered a six episode first season.[39] The series' remaining episodes began filming on June 2, 2010 with Darabont serving as showrunner.[40][41] On August 31, 2010, Darabont reported that The Walking Dead had been picked up for a second season, with production to begin in February 2011. On November 8, 2010, AMC confirmed that there would be a second season consisting of 13 episodes.[42] He would also like to include some of the "environmental elements" that take place during Volume 2 of Kirkman's book.[43]
Crew
The first season writing staff consisted of series developer and executive producer Frank Darabont (who wrote/co-wrote four of the six episodes), executive producer Charles H. Eglee, executive producer and creator of the comic book Robert Kirkman, co-executive producer Jack LoGiudice, consulting producer Adam Fierro and Glen Mazzara, all of whom contributed to one episode each. Along with Darabont, who directed the pilot episode, the remaining five were directed by Michelle MacLaren, Gwyneth Horder-Payton, Johan Renck, Ernest Dickerson and Guy Ferland.[44]


After the departure of Frank Darabont, the role of showrunner was assumed by Glen Mazzara (left) for seasons two and three, and Scott M. Gimple (right) for seasons four–present.
On December 1, 2010, Deadline.com reported that Darabont had fired his writing staff, including executive producer Charles "Chic" Eglee, and planned to use freelance writers for the second season.[45] Kirkman called the announcement "premature" and clarified that Eglee left to pursue other projects when Darabont decided to stay on as showrunner, and no definitive plans had been made regarding the writing staff for season two.[46]
[Chic Eglee] was brought onto The Walking Dead with the idea that Frank was going to work on the first season and then go off and do movies [...] Chic didn't want to be second-in-command on a show when he's used to being a top dog, and so he decided to go off and do something else, which is something that happens and is not a big deal.
—?Robert Kirkman, TV Guide[46]
On December 3, 2010, in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, executive producer Gale Anne Hurd commented: "It's completely inaccurate. [In] the writers' room, there are people that have set up other projects that will be their first priority if their own series is picked up as a pilot or if it's a series. I think [Eglee] just decided that he wants to run his own show." She revealed that it would be likely for the show to return in October 2011, as Darabont and Kirkman planned on mapping out the next season early in 2011. She also confirmed that, "every one of the principal cast is signed up for multiple seasons."[47] In July 2011, series developer and showrunner Frank Darabont stepped down from his position as showrunner for the series, over unclear circumstances (see Lawsuit below).[48]
Executive producer Glen Mazzara was appointed the new showrunner in Darabont's place.[49] New writers joined the writing staff in the second season, including co-executive producer Evan Reilly, producer Scott M. Gimple, story editor Angela Kang, and David Leslie Johnson. New writers in the third season included producers Nichole Beattie and Sang Kyu Kim, with Frank Renzullicontributing a freelance script.
After the conclusion of the third season, Glen Mazzara stepped down from his position as showrunner and executive producer for the series, per a mutual agreement between Mazzara and AMC. The press release read, "Both parties acknowledge that there is a difference of opinion about where the show should go moving forward, and conclude that it is best to part ways."[50] Scott M. Gimple succeeded Mazzara as showrunner for season four,[51] with new writers joining the writing staff, such as Curtis Gwinn, Channing Powell, and Matt Negrete.[52]
Writing
The television series generally tends to follow Kirkman's comic series across major characters and plots; for instance, events of the premiere episode of season 7 correlate to events in issue #100 of the comics.[53][54] The show does not attempt to go step-by-step with the comics, and has leeway in the narrative. In particular, the show's writers, along with Kirkman, often "transfer" how a character has died in the comics to a different character in the show. For example in season 3, whereas Tyreese is beheaded by The Governor in the standoff with Rick's group at the prison, the show transferred this fate to Hershel Greene.[53] Some of the television characters, like Carol, have far outlived their comic counterpart, while others that have already been killed off, like Sophia andAndrea, remain alive in the comic series.[54]
Music
Bear McCreary was hired to compose the score for the series. McCreary stated that the main theme was based on his viewing of production designs for the opening title sequence. Instead of doing a full theme song as with his earlier works, McCreary chose to use a simple, repeating motif from the strings section.[55]
It repeats over and over, and in fact in the pilot episode, you start hearing it before the main title begins, and this is something that continues episode to episode. You hear the main title music before the main title begins, so you know it's coming. That, to me, was the little hook – that little thing that, whenever you hear it, it takes you to the series.
—?Bear McCreary[55]
Soundtracks
Four soundtracks for The Walking Dead have been released to date. The Walking Dead: AMC Original Soundtrack, Vol. 1 was released on March 17, 2013.[56] The second volume was released on March 25, 2014.[57] Songs of Survival is a soundtrack for the third season and it was released on August 27, 2013, by Republic Records as a Walmart exclusive for the special edition release of the third season.[58] Songs of Survival, Vol. 2 is a soundtrack for the fourth season and it was released on August 26, 2014, by Republic Records as a Walmart exclusive of the fourth season release.[59]
Makeup
Gregory Nicotero is an executive producer and the key special effects makeup artist on the series. Each walker is put through "zombie school" and is taught how to move like zombies. There are three levels of zombie makeup: Hero, Midground, and Deep Background. Hero zombies are featured walkers and are completely made over from head to toe. Midground zombies get highlights and shadows on the face, but do not get close enough to the camera to require full makeup. Deep background zombies often wear masks and are only meant to be used as a backdrop.[60]
Filming

The Walking Dead is mostly filmed in Georgia.[61] The series is completely shot on 16 mm film.[62] David Tattersall was the director of photography for the pilot episode with David Boyd as the director of photography on the remainder of the episodes. Production design is done by Greg Melton and Alex Hajdu. The effects team includes veteran special effects makeup designer Gregory Nicotero, special effects coordinator Darrell Pritchett, and visual effects supervisors Sam Nicholson and Jason Sperling.[63]
Marketing
The Walking Dead debuted during the same week in 120 countries. As part of an expansive campaign to advertise and heighten anticipation for the premiere, AMC and Fox International Channels coordinated a worldwide zombie invasion event on October 26, 2010. The stunt involved invading 26 major cities within a 24-hour period, starting with Taipei and Hong Kong, and ending in Los Angeles for the U.S. premiere.[64]
The show's official website released, just prior to the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con International, a motion comic based on Issue No. 1 of the original comic and voiced by Phil LaMarr.[65] The site also posted a making-of documentary primarily about the first episode, as well as a number of other behind-the-scenes videos and interviews. In the documentary, comic series creator and show executive producer Robert Kirkman as well as artist Charlie Adlard say they are pleased with how faithful the show is to the comic and remark on the similarities between the actors and the comic's original character drawings.[66]
Action figures of characters from the series were created for release in November 2011 and have continued throughout the years with eight line-ups. The figures, which are manufactured byMcFarlane Toys, are designed to resemble the actors on the series. Figures created to resemble the characters as drawn in the comic book were released in September 2011.[67]
Green initiatives
With a primary objective of reducing the environmental impacts of film and television productions, including The Walking Dead, producer Gale Anne Hurd has directed the cast, crew, production team, suppliers, and bloggers about her shows to adopt the Doddle app to make the production almost paper-free; this works by digitally transmitting interactive call sheets and other intra-team and team-supplier communications (such as directions, images, menus, and updates) to people's cell phones and tablets. Hurd said of using Doddle: in addition to conserving paper, "It's also easier, and it's better for security. People are less likely to leave their smartphone or tablet lying around for someone else to pick up."[68][69]
Hurd describes additional steps taken to increase efficiency and cut production costs: "If you use vehicles that get better gas mileage, that are electric or hybrids, you're going to pay a lot less in fuel. If you use compact fluorescent bulbs, you're going to save a lot of money in utilities. If you recycle even your own sets, and use them again, that's going to save money. You don't have to buy new lumber. So there are cost savings, absolutely."[68] Additionally, the production team aims to reduce vehicle idling, which decreases carbon dioxide emissions.[68][69][70]
Hurd also cuts down on plastic waste by personally using a refillable, stainless steel EcoUsable water bottle and promoting its use among her colleagues. She shared: "on a lot of my projects I give them as crew gifts before we start production, and have water stations available, but you can't force people to use them."[68]

Parodies and spoofs
Due to its popularity, The Walking Dead has inspired dozens of parodies and spoofs featured on YouTube channels like Bad Lip Reading and TV shows such as Saturday Night Live[76][77][78] andMad TV.[79] Bad Lip Reading made a widely viewed parody involving Rick and the Governor, entitled "La-Bibbida-Bibba-Dum".[80] The series' cast was shown the parody at the 2013 San Diego Comic-Con International, and David Morrissey—who portrays the Governor— reacted by saying he now understood why so many people would walk up to him on the street and blurt, "Hey, La-Bibbida-Bibba-Dum!". Until seeing the video, he had wondered, "what's wrong with these people?"[81]

That site's consensus states, "Blood-spattered, emotionally resonant, and white-knuckle intense, The Walking Dead puts an intelligent spin on the overcrowded zombie subgenre."[106] Metacritic scored the first season 82/100 based on 25 critic reviews, 23 of which were positive, two mixed, and none negative.[100] Heather Havrilesky of Salon.com included the show on their list of 9 new TV shows not to miss, giving it a grade of "A", with the author saying, "A film-quality drama series about zombies? Somebody pinch me!"[107]
For the second season, 83% of 22 critic reviews on Rotten Tomatoes were positive, with an average score of 8.1/10. The site's consensus states, "The second season of The Walking Dead fleshes out the characters while maintaining the grueling tension and gore that made the show a hit."[108] Of 22 Metacritic critic reviews, 18 were positive, four were mixed, and none were negative; their average score was 80/100.[101] Early criticism of the show focused on the slow pace of the second season, particularly the first half. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly, described the series as "a nighttime soap", comparing it to "a parody of a Samuel Beckett play" that had very little sense of direction and few appearances of walkers.[109] Nate Rawlings ofTime's online entertainment section noted that "the pace during the first half of this season has been brutally slow. [...] They've tried to develop individual characters, but each subplot meant to add a layer to a character has been quickly resolved."[110]Later reviews from other critics, such as Scott Wampler of Collider.com, recognized the increased quality of the second half, stating it "seemed far more intense, more interesting, better written".[111] Recognizing the overall season, Kevin Yeoman ofScreen Rant offered praise saying "the writers succeeded in unshackling themselves from the intermittent monotony brought about by the serial nature of the show".[112]
The third season had 88% of Rotten Tomatoes' 30 critics giving it a positive review, with an average score of 8.1/10. The site's consensus states, "The palpable terror and visceral thrills continue in the third season of The Walking Dead, along with a deeper sense of the people who inhabit its apocalyptic landscape."[113] Metacritic's 19 critics rated the season 82/100, all of whom gave a positive review.[102] Verne Gay of Newsday claimed that the season 3 premiere "doesn't disappoint" going on to say that there are "spots where you will yell out at the screen, 'Oh, my God, that just didn't happen.' Yes, the new season is that good", concluding his review by giving the season an A+ rating.[114]
For season four, 86% of Rotten Tomatoes' 30 critic reviews were positive, with an average score of 7.7/10. The site's consensus states, "Consistently thrilling, with solid character development and enough gore to please grindhouse fans, this season of The Walking Dead continues to demonstrate why it's one of the best horror shows on television".[115] Metacritic scored the season 75/100 based on 16 critic reviews, 13 of which were positive, three mixed, and none negative.[103]
The fifth season had 90% of Rotten Tomatoes' 31 critic reviews rating it positively, with an average score of 7.9/10. The site's consensus states, "Thanks to a liberal dose of propulsive, bloody action and enough compelling character moments to reward longtime fans, The Walking Dead's fifth season continues to deliver top-notch entertainment."[116] Metacritic scored the fifth season 80/100 based on 11 critic reviews, all of which were positive.[104]
For season six, 78% of Rotten Tomatoes' 23 critic reviews were positive, with an average score of 7.4/10. The site's consensus states, "Six seasons in, The Walking Dead is still finding ways to top itself, despite slow patches that do little to advance the plot."[117] Metacritic scored the sixth season 79/100 based on 10 critic reviews, nine of which were positive, one mixed, and none negative.[105]

Lawsuit
Darabont's departure as showrunner in July 2011 during the second season came as surprise to many, as it came shortly after the season's premiere and a few days after that year's Comic-Conwhere Darabont helped to promote the show.[143] It was speculated that he was unable to adjust to the schedule of running a television series.[48] However, The Hollywood Reporter reported that AMC had fired him. There had been reported difficulties in the production of the second season including disputes over planned budget cuts and executive meddling, and it was known that Darabont and AMC had several discussions relating to these factors. However, neither Darabont, AMC, or the cast and crew of The Walking Dead spoke to the reasons for his firing.[144]
In December 2013, Darabont along with his agents from Creative Artists Agency (CAA) filed a lawsuit against AMC in a New York court, citing breach of contract. A central part of Darabont's lawsuit accuses AMC of denying him or the CAA the promised profits from the success of the series, based on how AMC had used vertical integration in producing and distributing The Walking Dead.[143]As stated in Darabont's filing, he had initially entered contract with AMC to have a third-party studio produce the show, from which he would have obtained 12.5% of that entity's profits, after standard deductions. AMC wanted to produce the show in-house, and for the first season, Darabont's lawyers had assured that Darabont would be protected from self-dealing fees by having AMC commit to imputed license fees equivalent to other independent studios, with Darabont earning profit from that. Darabont's suit contends that when the show's popularity took off, they presented a license fee deal to Darabont around February 2011 that used an "an unconscionably low license fee formula" such that AMC could report the show running at a loss and that Darabont would never see any profit from the show; as an example, the suit references statements in 2012, following the second season, that AMC claimed the show was running at a $49 million deficit, despite being one of the most popular shows in broadcast.[143] Darabont's suit contends he was fired just at the start of the second season so that AMC would avoid having to pay him.[143]
Initial discovery phase hearings were held in 2014. Darabont's lawyers sought to gain information from AMC on their other shows, specifically Breaking Bad and Mad Men, as to obtain a "fair market value" of what The Walking Dead should be worth. AMC asserted it had done no wrongdoing, and had already paid Darabont $3 million upfront for two seasons, and that they were able to properly set the imputed license fee that worked into the profit formula for Darabont. The network resisted the request to provide otherwise confidential information on these other shows.[145] The court granted Darabont's lawyers access to the requested information as part of the discovery phase.[146] Darabont described "crisis-level problems" during the show's production while under deposition, claiming that AMC had cut the per-episode budget from $3.4 million to $3 million while keeping the tax credit offered by the state of Georgia for filming there, effectively reducing the production budget by 25%.[147]
In August 2015, Darabont requested to amend his original complaint that AMC further reduced his profits from season two as his firing mid-season meant he was not fully vested in the season, allowing them to reduce the profits to him. Darabont's amended requests points out that he had written and produced all the episodes in that season already and was entitled to the proper profit share.[148] The judge granted this amendment in February 2016, partially influenced by concerns raised in Darabont's deposition.[149]
At the end of the discovery phase in September 2016, Darabont's lawyers stated they are seeking damages of over $280 million; AMC stated they will "vigorously" defend against the lawsuit. If the case does go to trial, it is expected to occur during 2018.[150]
