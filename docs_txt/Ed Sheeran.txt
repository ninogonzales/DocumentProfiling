Early life
Sheeran was born in Hebden Bridge, a market town in Calderdale near Halifax, West Yorkshire. His family moved to Framlingham in Suffolk when he was a child.[14] He has an older brother named Matthew, who was born on 17 March 1989.[15] Matthew studied music at university and is now a classical composer. Their parents, John and Imogen, are London-born. His paternal grandparents were Irish;[16][17][18] according to Sheeran, his father hailed from "a very large" Catholic family.[19] His paternal grandfather, Bill, was a Protestant and his wife, Ann, was Catholic.[17] Bill and Ann retired in Gorey, County Wexford.[20]
John is an art curator and lecturer, and Imogen is a culture publicist turned jewellery designer.[17][21] His parents ran Sheeran Lock, an independent art consultancy, from 1990 to 2010.[22] Their work usually took them to London, and they spent their weekends travelling with their children, while playing music. Sheeran's early childhood memories include listening to the records of Bob Dylan andEric Clapton. According to Sheeran, the album that first introduced him to music was Van Morrison's Irish Heartbeat.[17]
Sheeran sang in a local church choir from the age of four, learned to play the guitar at a very young age, and began writing songs while at Thomas Mills High School in Framlingham.[23][24] When he was eleven, he went with his father to a Damien Rice show in Ireland. In addition to Rice, he has also cited The Beatles, Dylan, Nizlopi and Eminem as his biggest musical influences.[25][26] He is a patron of the Youth Music Theatre UK[27] and of Access to Music, where he studied Artist Development course.[28][29] He was accepted at the National Youth Theatre in London as a teenager.[30][31]
Music career
2004–10: Career beginnings

Sheeran began recording music in 2004, and independently released his first collection of work, Spinning Man.[A] He has been friends with fellow English singer,Passenger, since he was 15, with the two playing on the same gig in Cambridge.[33] He moved to London in 2008, and began playing in small venues. In 2008, he auditioned for the ITV series, Britannia High.[34] He also opened for Nizlopi in Norwich in April 2008, after being one of their guitar technicians.[24] He released another EP in 2009, You Need Me, just before going on tour with Just Jack. He also did a few collaborations with Essex singer, Leddra Chapman, including CeeLo Green's "Fuck You". In February 2010, Sheeran posted a video through SB.TV, and rapper Example invited Sheeran to tour with him. In the same month, he also released his critically acclaimed Loose Change EP, which featured his future debut single, "The A Team".[35]
In April 2010, Sheeran bought a ticket to Los Angeles, with no contacts other than one poetry night. He played open mic nights all over the city, before he was spotted at The Foxxhole by Jamie Foxx, who was so impressed that he offered Sheeran the use of his recording studio and the bed of his Hollywood home for the rest of his stay. Throughout 2010, Sheeran began to be seen by more people over the internet through YouTube and his fan-base grew, with him also getting credit from The Independent newspaper, England football captain Rio Ferdinand and Elton John.[36] Sheeran also self-released two other EPs in 2010, Ed Sheeran: Live at the Bedford and Songs I Wrote with Amy, which is a collection of love songs he wrote in Wales with singer, Amy Wadge.[37]
On 8 January 2011, Sheeran released another independent EP, No. 5 Collaborations Project, featuring grime artists such as Wiley, Jme, Devlin, Sway and Ghetts.[38]With this EP, Sheeran gained mainstream attention for reaching number 2 in the iTunes chart without any promotion or label, selling over 7,000 copies in its first week.[39] Three months later, Sheeran put on a free show to fans at the Barfly in Camden Town. Over 1,000 fans turned up, so Sheeran played four different shows to ensure everyone saw a gig, including a gig outside on the street after the venue had closed. Later that month, Sheeran was signed to Asylum Records.[39]

Taylor Swift contacted Sheeran after hearing his music while touring Australia in March 2012.[62] He later co-wrote and provided vocals for "Everything Has Changed", a single featured on Swift's fourth studio album, Red.

John decided to appear with Sheeran to circumvent this problem.[65]

Sonically, the song is a departure from Sheeran's previous recordings.[74][75] "Sing" was intended to create hype over the album release, but from concern that this might alienate Sheeran's fan base, "One", an acoustic ballad, was released on 16 May 2014;[67][76] "One" also marked the first of several promotional singles released leading to the album release. By early June 2014, "Sing" had earned Sheeran his first number-one single in the UK.[77]

"It's good to show insight that these people are real people with real emotions and they deserve the same charity work as anyone else," Sheeran said. "There's a lot more popular charities that get a lot of attention. And with certain subjects like this they're often washed over and people don't necessarily give them the attention they deserve." Tickets were available to those taking part in the charity's Give it up for One25 campaign by giving something up for 125 hours and hitting the £40,000 fundraising mark.[105]

Notes
1. Jump up^ "In 2004, I made my very first album, Spinning Man, named after a picture that my dad had. I burnt the CDs myself and made the covers. There were 14 songs and they were all songs that rhymed. One lyric went: ‘I’m a typical average teen, if you know what I mean.’ There are probably 20 copies of Spinning Man in existence and I have 19 of them. I don’t want anyone else to get hold of a copy. Most of the songs were about a girl called Claire. She was my first love when I was 13. It was a very innocent love and we only ever held hands, but it lasted a fair amount of time. Then came my first devastating break-up. Looking back, it really wasn’t that bad, but at the time it was soul-shattering. When she left me, I wrote a lot of songs off the back of it – my first love songs."[32]
