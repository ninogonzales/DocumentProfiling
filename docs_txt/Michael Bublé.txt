Early life[edit]
Bublé was born in Burnaby, British Columbia to Lewis Bublé, a salmon fisherman,[7] and Amber (née Santaga).[8] He has two younger sisters,[9] Brandee, a children's book author, and Crystal, an actress. The siblings were raised in the Roman Catholic faith. He attended Seaforth Elementary School and Cariboo Hill Secondary School.[10]
According to an Oprah interview on 9 October 2009, Bublé dreamed of becoming a famous singer since he was two years old. When he was a teenager, he slept with his Bible and prayed to become a singer.[11][12] Bublé's interest in jazz music began around age five[13] when his family played Bing Crosby's White Christmas album at Christmastime.[13][14][15]
The first time his family noticed his singing talent was at Christmastime when Bublé was 13 years old, and they heard him powerfully sing the phrase "May your days be merry and bright" when the family was singing to the song "White Christmas" on a car ride.[11][16]
Bublé had a strong passion for ice hockey and wanted to become a professional hockey player for the Vancouver Canucks growing up, but believed he was not good at it,[17] stating: "I wanted so bad to be a hockey player... If I was any good at hockey, I probably wouldn't be singing right now."[18] Bublé often played hockey in his youth,[19][20] watched Vancouver Canucks games with his father,[21] and said that he "went to every single home game as a kid... I remember I wanted to be Gary Lupul, I wanted to be Patrik Sundstrom and Ivan Hlinka. I used to think that being named Michael Bublé was pretty cool because I was close to being called Jiri Bubla."[19] Bublé shared his hockey interest with his grandfather.[22]
From age 14, Bublé spent six years working during the summer as a commercial fisherman with his father and crewmates.[7][23] Bublé described his work experience as "The most deadly physical work I'll ever know in my lifetime. We’d be gone for two, sometimes three months at a time and the experience of living and working among guys over twice my age taught me a lot about responsibility and what it means to be a man."[9]
His first singing engagements were in nightclubs at the age of 16 and were facilitated by his Italian grandfather Demetrio Santagà,[24] a plumber originally from the small town of Preganziol,[25] in the district of Treviso, who offered his plumbing services in exchange for stage time for his grandson.[9] Bublé's grandfather paid for his singing lessons. One of his vocal instructors was Joseph Shore, the opera baritone.[16] His maternal grandfather never stopped believing that he would become a star. Bublé's maternal grandmother, Iolanda (née Moscone),[26] was also Italian, from Carrufo,[26]Villa Santa Lucia degli Abruzzi, Italy.[27] His father is also of Italian descent.[28] His original brush with entertainment was as a children's entertainer using the name Mickey Bubbles.[29]
Bublé grew up listening to his grandfather's collection of jazz records and credits his grandfather in encouraging his love for jazz music. "My grandfather was really my best friend growing up. He was the one who opened me up to a whole world of music that seemed to have been passed over by my generation. Although I like rock 'n' roll and modern music, the first time my granddad played me the Mills Brothers, something magical happened. The lyrics were so romantic, so real, the way a song should be for me. It was like seeing my future flash before me. I wanted to be a singer and I knew that this was the music that I wanted to sing."[30] Bublé never stopped believing he would become a star but admitted he was probably the only one who believed in his dream, stating that even his maternal grandfather thought Bublé was going to be "an opening act for somebody in Las Vegas".[31] He stated he never learned to read and write music, using only emotion to drive his songwriting ability.[17][32][33]
At the age of 18, Bublé entered a local talent contest and won. But after winning, he was disqualified by organizer Bev Delich because he was underage. After that, Delich entered Bublé in the Canadian Youth Talent Search, which he won. Following that win, Bublé asked Delich to be his manager. Delich signed on and represented Bublé for the next seven not-so-fruitful years. According to Delich, Bublé would do every gig imaginable, including talent shows, conventions, cruise ships, malls, hotel lounges, bars, clubs, corporate gigs, musical revues, singing telegrams, and even the occasional singing Santa Claus gig.[16][23][34]
In 1996, Bublé appeared in TV's Death Game (aka Mortal Challenge) as a Drome Groupie. Also in 1996, he appeared (uncredited) in two episodes of The X-Files as a member of a submarine crew.
Bublé's first national TV performance was on a 1997 award-winning Bravo! documentary titled Big Band Boom!, directed by Mark Glover Masterson. Beginning in 1997, he became a frequent guest on Vicki Gabereau's national talk show on the CTV network. During its first season, the Vancouver-based program aired live, which ultimately worked in Bublé's favour. When a scheduled guest was forced to cancel, the show's music producer often asked Bublé to fill in at the last minute. The Gabereau appearances provided Bublé with great exposure, but they also helped the singer hone his television skills as a performer and as an interview guest. In a mutual show of gratitude, Bublé appeared on the final Gabereau show in 2005, along with Jann Arden and Elvis Costello.[35]
Bublé received two Genie Award-nominations in 2000 for two songs he wrote for the film Here's to Life! ("I've Never Been in Love Before", "Dumb ol' Heart"). He recorded three independent albums (First Dance, 1996; Babalu, 2001; Dream, 2002).[36][37]
Music career[edit]
2000–02: Musical beginnings[edit]
Bublé's career breakthrough came in 2000 from a surprising chain of events. Michael McSweeney, an aide to former Prime Minister, Brian Mulroney, saw Bublé's performance at a business party[16]and received a copy of Bublé's self-financed independent album. McSweeney showed the album to Mulroney and his wife. Bublé subsequently was invited to sing at the wedding of Mulroney's daughter, Caroline, where he sang Kurt Weill's "Mack the Knife".[16] At the wedding Bublé was introduced to David Foster, a multi-Grammy Award-winning producer and record executive who previously had worked with artists such as Madonna, Brandy Norwood, Whitney Houston, Michael Jackson, Céline Dion, Barbra Streisand, Kenny G., Cher, Josh Groban, and Andrea Bocelli.[16][38]
Initially, David Foster was reluctant to sign Bublé to his 143 Records label because he "didn't know how to market this kind of music." Bublé moved to Los Angeles with his agent for a brief period to convince Foster to sign him. Eventually, Foster agreed to produce an album for him if he raised $500,000 to cover the costs of the production (which Bublé did). Foster ended up covering the costs of production under his label, with no assurances of support from Warner Brothers, and after Bublé received the personal stamp of approval and support of Foster's friend, musician and songwriterPaul Anka. After David Foster agreed to produce Bublé’s debut album, Bruce Allen, whom Bublé had pursued for years to be his manager, also signed Bublé.[39]
Bublé did some acting in this period; as a karaoke singer in Duets in 2000, and as Van Martin (a club owner) in Totally Blonde in 2001, produced by Andrew Van Slee.
2003–04: Michael Bublé[edit]
Bublé's self-titled debut album was released 11 February 2003 by 143 Records/Reprise Records. The album features a range of standards from various eras including "Fever", "The Way You Look Tonight", "For Once in My Life", "Moondance" and "You'll Never Find Another Love Like Mine". Also on the album is "How Can You Mend a Broken Heart?", with Barry Gibb of the Bee Gees singing back up vocals. The album went to the top 10 in Canada, United Kingdom, South Africa and reached No. 1 in Australia. It was No. 33 on the ARIA Top 100 Albums of 2003.[40] It achieved marginal success in the United States reaching the top 50 on the Billboard 200. Three tracks from the album (Kissing a Fool, How Can You Mend a Broken Heart?, Sway) reached the top 30 on the BillboardHot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart.[citation needed]
Bublé appeared nationally on television in the United States on the Today program on 14 February 2003.[41] A campaign featuring "Fever" was launched before Valentine's Day with a quirky marketing campaign that simply stated "You pronounce it Boo-blay." The album went Gold there. Then he began to travel all over the world to promote the album. The tour included Singapore, South Africa, the Philippines, the UK, Canada, South America, and eventually the United States.[citation needed]
In November 2003, Bublé released a Christmas EP Let it Snow, containing five previously unreleased tracks, that peaked at 56 on the Billboard 200. The title track reached the top 40 of the Australia singles chart. A live DVD/CD called Come Fly with Me was released in early 2004. The Come Fly with Me CD was No. 99 on the Aria Top 100 Albums of 2004.[40] The DVD included live footage and behind the scenes footage of Bublé's first world tour. The CD included three new studio tracks, two live recordings of new songs, and three live recordings of songs from the albumMichael Bublé. The album peaked at 55 on the Billboard 200. In November 2004 the Christmas edition of his debut album was released as a two-disc set that included both the Michael Bublé and the "Let It Snow" EP.
Bublé won the "New Artist of the Year" award at the 2004 Juno Awards, and his album was nominated for "Album of the Year", but lost out to Sam Roberts. He appeared in the 2003 film The Snow Walker. Also in 2003 he portrayed a lounge performer on an episode of Days of Our Lives.[41] In 2004 he appeared as himself in Las Vegas.
Songs from Bublé's debut album ("For Once in My Life", "Kissing a Fool") were released on the soundtrack for the movie Down with Love (2003).[42] The soundtrack also included a previously unreleased duet with Holly Palmer of the movie's title theme. The Junkie XL remix of the theme for the 1960s TV cartoon version of Spider-Man from Bublé's Babalu album was played during the closing credits of Spider-Man 2 (2004), and this version was also released as a single. A CD was released in 2003 of the 7 songs that Bublé sang for Totally Blonde, calling it Totally Bublé.
After the success of Bublé's self-titled debut, DRG Records belatedly released the jazzy soundtrack from the 2001 film, Totally Blonde in which Bublé had a co-starring role as a nightclub singer/club owner. Capitalizing on Bublé's newfound stardom, DRG Records basically ignored the music's connection to the film by altering the title and putting a shot of Bublé on the cover making it appear as if this was a proper Michael Bublé release. The slight misrepresentation was not lost on Bublé who has stated on his website that he did not want these songs released, but that it was out of his control.[43]
2005–06: It's Time[edit]

Problems playing this file? See media help.Bublé's second studio album, It's Time, was released 15 February 2005, again by 143/Reprise Records. The album also included standards from a variety of eras including "You Don't Know Me", "Feeling Good", "Can't Buy Me Love", "Save the Last Dance for Me", "Song for You", and "Quando, Quando, Quando" (a duet with Canadian pop singer Nelly Furtado). It also included an original track, "Home", co-written by Bublé, his musical director Alan Chang, and Amy Foster-Gilles (David Foster’s daughter).[citation needed]
The album reached No. 1 in Canada, Italy, Japan, and on the Billboard Top Jazz chart, No. 2 in Australia, and No. 7 on the Billboard 200. Additionally it reached the top 10 in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Norway, Austria, and Sweden. The album spent 104 weeks on the Billboard Top Jazz chart, including a record-breaking 78 weeks in the No. 1 spot.[44] It's Time was Billboard's Top Jazz Album in both 2005 and 2006. The first single, "Feeling Good", met with little commercial success. However, the second single from the album, "Home", reached No. 1 on Billboard Adult Contemporary Tracks chart and No. 72 on the Billboard Hot 100.[45] The third single "Save the Last Dance for Me" reached No. 5 on the Billboard AC Track Chart and No. 99 on the Billboard Hot 100.[45] Possibly known as his claim to fame album. Although some songs in this album featured a covered song ("Feling Good", first performed by Cy Grant in 1964), Bublé's original track "Home" had a lot of success.
In 2005, he appeared in a commercial for Starbucks' Frappucino line, singing his single "Come Fly with Me". The single appeared as a bonus track for a Starbucks edition release of It's Time.[46]
Bublé won four Juno Awards in 2006 for Pop Album of the Year for his 143/Reprise set [5] It's Time, Single of the Year–"Home", Album of the Year–It's Time, Artist of the Year, and was additionally nominated for the Juno Fan Choice Award, but lost out to the Canadian pop band Simple Plan.[6] Bublé was nominated twice for a Grammy in the category Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album in 2006 (It's Time) and 2007 (Caught in the Act) but lost, in both cases, to Tony Bennett. In 2007, Bublé received one Juno nomination, for Fan Choice, but lost to Nelly Furtado.[47]
2007–08: Call Me Irresponsible[edit]
Bublé's third studio album, Call Me Irresponsible, was released 1 May 2007 by 143/Reprise Records. His third effort included songs from different eras like as "Always on My Mind", "Dream", "I've Got the World on a String", and "Comin' Home Baby" (a duet with Boyz II Men). In the US, the album debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 and rose to number one in its second week. Only a few artists have been able to accomplish this, like Michael Jackson and Sugarland.[48]
The album sold nearly 2 million copies in the US alone. Internationally, the album fared well. In Australia, the album debuted in the top position, and was the best-selling album of the year 2007. In the UK, both the standard version and the special edition were best-selling albums, with the latter outselling the former (standard: 300,000; special edition: 462,000). Additionally, the album was certified 2× Platinum in Europe with over 2 million copies sold. Call Me Irresponsible has sold over 5 million copies worldwide.[citation needed]
The first single off the album was "Everything". It carried a more adult-contemporary sound than his usual big band style and was released in May 2007. The song became one of Bublé's biggest hits ever, reaching No. 46 on the Billboard Hot 100, No. 1 on the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart, and No. 10 in Canada. "Me and Mrs. Jones" was set to be released as the second single off the album but was cancelled despite a music video being made. The next single, released in November 2007, was "Lost", a No. 97 hit on the Hot 100 and No. 19 in the UK. "It Had Better Be Tonight (Meglio Stasera)" was released mainly as a remix single, with many mixes by Eddie Amador. The song reached position No. 89 in Canada. The final single from the album Comin' Home Baby was released in April 2008.[49]
2009–2012: Crazy Love and Christmas[edit]

Bublé in Vancouver (March 2009)
Michael Bublé's third DVD (after Caught in the Act and Come Fly with Me) titled Michael Bublé Meets Madison Square Garden was released on 16 June 2009. An exclusive trailer premiered online at his website.[citation needed]
The standard CD contains 10 live tracks and has an orange cover. The online edition contains two additional tracks ("Sway" and "That's Life") and has a blue-coloured alternate cover. In 2009, Bublé was featured in the CTV television movie My Musical Brain with neuroscientist and writer Daniel Levitin, based on Levitin's bestselling book This Is Your Brain On Music. His fourth studio album, Crazy Love, was due for release by 143/Reprise Records on 13 October 2009.[50] However, an early release in the United States occurred on 9 October 2009,[51] in which Bublé appeared on Oprah that same day and performed the album's first single "Haven't Met You Yet". The album was also promoted in an interview with George Stroumboulopoulos on The Hour on 17 October 2009,[52] and on 22 December 2009 episode of The Glenn Beck Program.[53]
This album contains 12 tracks (and one bonus track), including two original songs co-written by Bublé, "Haven't Met You Yet" and "Hold On".[54] Its first single, "Haven't Met You Yet" was released 31 August 2009, and reached No. 1 on Billboard's Canadian Adult Contemporary chart.[55] Most of the tracks off the album were recorded live because Bublé did not want his album to sound overproduced and slick.[56] Bublé wrote the opening part for his cover on the single "Cry Me a River" in Bond-like theme because he wanted the song to sound very cinematic and bombastic.[57]
Crazy Love debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart,[58] becoming Bublé's fourth No. 1 album on Billboard's Top Jazz Albums chart. It also debuted at No. 1 in Australia and Canada, where it became his fastest-selling album.[59] The album was supported by the (ongoing) Crazy Love Tour. During the tour, Bublé performed two nights at the new Aviva Stadium in Dublin, Ireland, which were the first concerts to take place at the venue. The stadium holds 51,700 (which is excluding taped off areas) and all tickets sold out in one day. The first night of the tour was Bublé's largest ever audience.[citation needed]
In 2009, Bublé took part in series 6 of The X Factor in the UK on the ITV network. He was the celebrity mentor for the finalists in week 3 and also appeared on the finale, duetting with Stacey Solomon. Bublé was the musical guest on Saturday Night Live on 30 January 2010. He sang "Haven't Met You Yet", as well as "Baby (You've Got What It Takes)" with Sharon Jones, and did a sketch with Jon Hamm for "Hamm & Bublé Restaurant".[citation needed]

Bublé re-released Crazy Love on 25 October 2010 in the US, with an earlier release date of 15 October 2010 for Europe. The special edition is called "Crazy Love: Hollywood Edition",[67] and contains several bonus tracks including Bublé's newest single, "Hollywood", co-written with Toronto songwriter/pianist Robert G. Scott.[68] On 7 September 2010, "Hollywood" was released worldwide on radio and as a digital single on iTunes. He recently played to 100,000 people at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin, his biggest concert to date.[67]
Bublé was featured in an ITV special called This Is Michael Bublé. The special featured concert footage from his gigs at Aviva Stadium. On 23 February 2011, he featured as the narrator of BBC Radio 2's Song Stories: "My Way".[69]
