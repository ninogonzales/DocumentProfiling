The series focuses on the fictional lives of surgical interns, residents, and attendings as they gradually evolve into seasoned doctors, while trying to maintain personal lives and relationships. The title is a play on Gray's Anatomy, a human anatomy textbook by Henry Gray. The show's premise originated with Shonda Rhimes, who serves as an executive producer, along with Betsy Beers, Mark Gordon, Krista Vernoff,Rob Corn, Mark Wilding, and Allan Heinberg. Although the show is set in Seattle at the fictional Grey-Sloan Memorial Hospital (Formerly Seattle Grace-Mercy West) it is primarily filmed in Los Angeles, California. The show was originally titled Complications following the complicated medical procedures and personal lives of the cast.
The series was created to be racially diverse, utilizing a color-blind casting technique. It revolves around the title character Dr. Meredith Grey played byEllen Pompeo. The series' original cast consisted of nine star billed cast members including Ellen Pompeo, Sandra Oh, Katherine Heigl, Justin Chambers, T. R. Knight, Chandra Wilson, James Pickens Jr., Isaiah Washington and Patrick Dempsey. The cast has undergone major changes throughout the run of the show, with many major cast members leaving and being replaced by several new characters. The series in its twelfth seasonhad a large ensemble of sixteen actors, including four from the original cast. On March 3, 2016, ABC renewed Grey's Anatomy for a thirteenth season, which premiered on September 22, 2016.[1]
Grey's Anatomy is one of the highest-rated dramas in the 18–49 demographic. Although the ratings have fallen over the past few seasons, it was once among the overall top 10 shows in the United States. Grey's Anatomy has been well received by critics, considered an impact on culture, the series has received numerous awards, and has also been included in various critics' top ten lists. It is the recipient of the 2007 Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series — Drama, and multiple Emmy nominations, including two for Outstanding Drama Series. The show has produced several specials, as well as distributed all seasons to DVD, and released a collection of merchandise. In 2012, Grey's Anatomy was named the fifth-highest revenue earning show, in terms of advertising per half-hour. It's the longest running scripted primetime show currently airing on ABC and the second longest scripted primetime show ever on ABC only behind The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet.

Plot[edit]
The series follows Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), the daughter of an esteemed general surgeon named Ellis Grey, following her acceptance into the residency program at the fictional Seattle Grace Hospital. During her tenure as a resident, Grey works alongside fellow doctors Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh), Alex Karev (Justin Chambers), Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl), and George O'Malley (T. R. Knight), who each struggle to balance their personal lives with the hectic work and training schedules assigned to them. They are overseen during their internship by Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson), a senior resident who works beneath Grey's love-interest Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey), the head of neurosurgery; Yang's fiancee Preston Burke(Isaiah Washington), the head of cardio; and Ellis Grey's ex-lover Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.), the Chief of Surgery. The residents are later joined by Jackson Avery (Jesse Williams) and April Kepner (Sarah Drew), former Mercy-West residents who join Seattle Grace following an administrative merger in the sixth season. Throughout the first six seasons O'Malley, Burke and Stevens all depart the series which has become very controversial in the media over the life-span of the series. In addition to Shepherd, Webber, and Burke, the surgical wing is primarily supervised byOwen Hunt (Kevin McKidd), as head of trauma; Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw), as head of pediatric surgery; Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez), a resident who later becomes head of orthopedic surgery, who left Seattle at the end of the twelfth season; Erica Hahn (Brooke Smith), as head of cardio;Mark Sloan (Eric Dane), as head of plastics; Addison Montgomery (Kate Walsh), as head of OB/GYN, neonatal, and fetal surgery; Teddy Altman (Kim Raver), as head of cardio; and Amelia Shepherd (Caterina Scorsone), Derek's sister who is hired to replace him as head of neuro.
Later additions to the residency program include Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh), Meredith's half-sister. Grey is killed alongside Mark Sloan in the season eight finale; Leah Murphy (Tessa Ferrer); Shane Ross (Gaius Charles), who departs alongside Yang in the tenth season finale; Stephanie Edwards (Jerrika Hinton); Jo Wilson (Camilla Luddington), a doctor who begins a romantic relationship with Karev; Andrew Deluca (Giacomo Gianniotti), the love-interest of Meredith's half sister Maggie Pierce (Kelly McCreary), who also serves as head of cardio; and Benjamin Warren (Jason George), an anesthesiologist and currently a resident,[2] who has to balance his wife Miranda Bailey's new role as Chief of Surgery with his own desire to succeed. Season twelve sees the arrival of Nathan Riggs (Martin Henderson), while Meredith is appointed head of general surgery.
Production and development[edit]
Conception[edit]
Shonda Rhimes, the series' creator, wanted to make a show that she would enjoy watching,[3] and thought it would be interesting to create a show about "smart women competing against one another".[4] When asked how she decided to develop a medical drama, Rhimes responded:
“I was obsessed with the surgery channels. [...] My sisters and I would call each other up and talk about operations we'd seen on the Discovery Channel. There's something fascinating about the medical world—you see things you'd never imagine, like the fact that doctors talk about their boyfriends or their day while they're cutting somebody open. So when ABC asked me to write another pilot, the [operating room] seemed like the natural setting.[5]”The series was pitched to ABC Entertainment, who gave the green light, and the show was picked up as a mid-season replacement for Boston Legal in the 2005 television season.[6] Francie Calfo, executive vice president of development at ABC Entertainment, commented that ABC was looking for a medical show that was unlike the others airing at the time. She pointed out that "[m]edical shows are hard, and it was hard trying to figure out where ours could be different. But where everybody else is speeding up their medical shows, [Rhimes] found a way to slow it down, so you get to know the characters. There's definitely a strong female appeal to it."[4]
"ER is high-speed medicine. The camera flies around, adrenaline is rushing. My show is more personal. The idea for the series began when a doctor told me it was incredibly hard to shave her legs in the hospital shower. At first that seemed like a silly detail. But then I thought about the fact that it was the only time and place this woman might have to shave her legs. That's how hard the work is."
— Rhimes on the creation of Grey's Anatomy[5]
Rhimes initially conceived Grey's Anatomy as a statement against racism. She endeavored to create a show that featured a racially diverse cast that allowed viewers to relate to characters regardless of race.[7] While creating characters, as well as writing the first script, the series' writers had no character descriptions in mind, and hoped to cast the best actor available for each part. Rhimes has explained that if the network did not allow her to create characters this way, she would have been hesitant about moving forward with the series.[5] Female roles in particular were developed as multi-faceted characters. Rhimes offered her insight on this, "I wanted to create a world in which you felt as if you were watching very real women. Most of the women I saw on TV didn't seem like people I actually knew. They felt like ideas of what women are. They never got to be nasty or competitive or hungry or angry. They were often just the loving wife or the nice friend. But who gets to be the bitch? Who gets to be the three-dimensional woman?"[5]
Before the series debuted on March 27, 2005, there were a few early releases to close friends and family of the producers and actors. The show was scheduled to run in the Boston Legal time slot for four weeks. However, high ratings and viewership led to it holding onto the slot for the remainder of the season.[4] ABC Entertainment President, Steve McPherson, commented on the scheduling change: "Ultimately we decided that, without having adequate lead time or marketing dollars to devote to moving either show so late in the season, we'd continue to let [Grey's Anatomy] build on its tremendous momentum through May."[8] The show's title, Grey's Anatomy, was devised as a play on words: a reference to both Henry Gray's medical textbook, Gray's Anatomy, and the title character Dr. Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo).[9] Prior to broadcast, it was announced that the show's title would change from Grey's Anatomy to Complications, although ultimately this did not come to pass.[10]
Production team[edit]
Grey's Anatomy is produced by ShondaLand, in association with The Mark Gordon Company, and ABC Studios (formerly Touchstone Television).[11]Rhimes, Betsy Beers, Krista Vernoff, Mark Gordon, Rob Corn, and Mark Wilding have all served as executive producers throughout the course of the series.[12] In subsequent seasons, Steve Mulholland, Kent Hodder, Nancy Bordson, James D. Parriott, and Peter Horton have also been executive producers, with Allan Heinberg joining the show in 2006 in this role.[12] As of season eight, the current executive producers are Rhimes, Beers, Gordon, Vernoff, Corn, Wilding, and Heinberg.[13]
Rhimes is the series' most prolific writer. She often promotes the show by answering fan questions on her Twitter account.[14] Other members of the writing staff are Vernoff, Wilding, Peter Nowalk, Stacy McKee, William Harper, Zoanne Clack, Tony Phelan, Joan Rater, and Debora Cahn.[12] From the second through seventh seasons, the writers maintained a blog entitled Grey Matter, where the writer of an episode discussed the motives behind the writing.[15] Directors vary by episode, with Rob Corn directing most frequently, followed by Tom Verica. Horton, Edward Ornelas, and Jessica Yu have also directed a substantial number of episodes.[12] Cast members Chandra Wilson and Kevin McKidd have both directed multiple episodes.[16]
Grey's Anatomy has been edited by Susan Vaill since the show's inception,[17] and David Greenspan was named an editor in 2006.[18] Casting directors Linda Lowy and John Brace have been a part of the production team since 2005. Production design is led by Donald Lee Harris, assisted by art director Brian Harms, and costume design is led by Mimi Melgaard. Working alongside Melgaard, Thomas Houchins supervises costumes, Ellen Vieira is the makeup artist, and Jerilynn Stevens serves as a hair stylist. The Director of Photography is Herbert Davis. The music coordinator is Danny Lux.[17] Karen Lisa Pike, M.D. is the on-set medical consultant, alongside Linda Klein, a RN.[19] The production staff is part of a Grey's Anatomy softball team that competes against other television shows, such as CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.[20]
Casting[edit]
Main article: List of Grey's Anatomy cast members
"She brought this energy that felt very fresh. From the beginning, I've been shaping Cristina around Sandra a little bit. One of my favorite things to do is take as much of her dialogue out of a scene as possible because she does so much nonverbally. Then I just watch what she manages to do without having a word to say."
— Rhimes on Oh's audition[21]
Grey's Anatomy used a color-blind casting technique, resulting in a racially diverse ensemble. Each role was cast without the character's races being pre-determined, keeping Rhimes' vision of diversity.[22] The production staff began casting with the program's title character, Meredith Grey,[5] which Rhimes stated was a difficult role to cast.[23] "I kept saying we need a girl like that girl from Moonlight Mile[a]," said Rhimes, "and after a while, they were like, 'We think we can get that girl from Moonlight Mile."[23] The next to be cast, Sandra Oh (Dr. Cristina Yang), was initially invited to audition for the character of Bailey, but pressed to read for the role of Cristina instead.[24] Many actors read for the role of Dr. Derek Shepherd, but when Patrick Dempsey read for the part, "he was just perfect", according to Rhimes.[23]
The only character developed with a racial description in mind was Dr. Miranda Bailey, who is portrayed by Chandra Wilson. Her character was written as a tiny blonde with curly hair, but when Wilson began speaking, Rhimes reported: "[Wilson] is exactly who Miranda is."[5] James Pickens Jr. was selected to appear as Dr. Richard Webber in the series' pilot and first season.[25] Katherine Heigl wanted to portray Dr. Izzie Stevens as a brunette, but was requested to retain her natural blonde for the part.[26] Isaiah Washington, who portrayed Dr. Preston Burke, initially read for the role of Shepherd, but was cast as Burke, because the original actor to play Burke had to withdraw.[22] T. R. Knight signed on for the pilot as Dr. George O'Malley, expecting that the role might be short-lived, because he liked that the character was multi-faceted.[27] Rounding out the season one cast was Justin Chambers as Dr. Alex Karev.[28]

Eric Dane originally auditioned for the pilot episodeof Grey's Anatomy, but did not receive a role.
The second season marked the introduction of Dr. Mark Sloan (Eric Dane) and Dr. Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez). They were initially cast as recurring characters, but both were given star billing at the opening of the third season.[29][30] Ramirez was cast after ABC executives offered her a role in the network show of her choice,[31]Dane had previously auditioned unsuccessfully for a role in the pilot episode.[30] Dr. Addison Montgomery (Kate Walsh) also joined the show in season two, after making a guest appearance in season one.[32] In October 2006, Washington allegedly insulted Knight with a homophobic slur, during an on-set altercation with Dempsey, and ABC terminated Washington's contract at the end of the third season.[33] Washington also made a guest appearance in season 10. At the conclusion of the third season, Walsh also departed the show to pursue the Grey's Anatomy spin-off, Private Practice, but continues to make guest appearances.[34]
Chyler Leigh joined the cast as a main character in the fourth season as Dr. Lexie Grey, Lexie had appeared as a guest star in the final two episodes of the third season.[35] On the selection of Leigh for the role of Lexie, Rhimes said: "Chyler stood out...It felt like she could be Meredith's sister, but she had a depth that was very interesting."[36] Dr. Erica Hahn (Brooke Smith ), who first appeared on Grey's Anatomy in the second season, became a series regular in the fourth season.[37]Shortly after the announcement that Smith would be a regular member of the cast, Entertainment Weekly's Michael Ausiello, reported that her character, Hahn, would depart from Grey's Anatomy on November 6, 2008.[38] E! Online's Kristin Dos Santos asserted that Smith's dismissal from the show had been forced by the ABC network, as part of an attempt to "de-gay" Grey's Anatomy,[39] but Rhimes countered these claims, saying that "we did not find that the magic and chemistry with Brooke's character would sustain in the long run".[38]
Season five introduced actor Kevin McKidd (Dr. Owen Hunt), who was signed as a series regular after originally being cast for a specific story arc.[40] In addition,Jessica Capshaw (Dr. Arizona Robbins) was originally introduced for a three episode arc, but received a contract extension until the end of the season and then became a series regular in the sixth season.[41] Knight departed the show at the conclusion of season five, citing an unhappiness with the development and lack of screen time for his character.[42] Directly following Knight's departure, it was reported by Entertainment Weekly that Heigl had not returned to the set as scheduled after her maternity leave,[43] and it was later confirmed that Heigl would not return to the show at all.[44]
Kim Raver, who was cast as recurring character Dr. Teddy Altman in the sixth season, was given star billing later in the season.[45] Sarah Drew (Dr. April Kepner) and Jesse Williams (Dr. Jackson Avery), who both made their series debuts as recurring characters in the sixth season, received star billing in the seventh.[46][47]
The six original actors' contracts expired after season eight, but in May 2012, Pompeo, Oh, Dempsey, Chambers, Wilson, and Pickens renewed their contracts with the show for another two years.[48] At the conclusion of the eighth season, Leigh's character departed from the show at Leigh's request, and with Rhimes' agreement.[49][50] Raver's character was also written out of the show during the season eight finale, and Rhimes stated that Raver was offered a contract renewal, but declined.[51] In July 2012, Dane confirmed that he was departing the show to pursue other projects; he made his final appearances in the first two episodes of the ninth season.[52] With the start of season 10, Camilla Luddington, Jerrika Hinton, Gaius Charles & Tessa Ferrer were introduced to the show as series regulars. They were first introduced to the show in season 9 as new interns. On August 13, 2013, Oh announced that the show's tenth season would be her final season.[53][54] In March 2014 it was announced that Isaiah Washington, who portrayed Preston Burke in the first three seasons of the show, would make a guest appearance to coincide with the departure of series regular Sandra Oh, his former on-screen love interest.[55] As of March 25, 2014, both Charles and Ferrer's contracts were not renewed for season 11.[56] On May 2, 2014 it was announced that, in addition to Pompeo and Dempsey, all original remaining cast members — aside from Sandra Oh — signed two year deals, extending their contracts through seasons 11 and 12. Despite joining the series in its second season, Sara Ramirez is on the same negotiation schedule as the first season cast and has also inked a new two-year deal.[57][58][59]
Filming locations and technique[edit]

The Space Needle, in Seattle, is the background to many exterior shots.
Rhimes considered setting the medical drama in her hometown, Chicago, but eventually decided to go with Seattle, to distinguish Grey's Anatomy from the Chicago–based ER.[23]
Fisher Plaza, which is the headquarters building of Fisher Communications and Fisher's ABC affiliated KOMO radio and television stations in Seattle, is used for some exterior shots of Grey-Sloan Memorial Hospital. In particular, air ambulances land on the KOMO-TV newscopter's helipad. This suggests the hospital is close to the Space Needle (which is directly across the street from Fisher Plaza), the Seattle Monorail, and other local landmarks. However, the hospital used for most other exterior and a few interior shots is not in Seattle; these scenes are shot at the VA Sepulveda Ambulatory Care Center in North Hills, California.[60] The exterior of Meredith Grey's house, also known as the Intern House, is real. In the show, the address of Grey's home is 613 Harper Lane, but in real life there is no such place. The actual home is located at 303 W. Comstock St., Seattle, Washington. Most scenes are taped at Prospect Studios in Los Feliz, just east of Hollywood, where the Grey's Anatomy set occupies six sound stages. Some outside scenes are shot at the Warren G. Magnuson Park in Seattle. Several props used are working medical equipment, including the MRI machine.[61] When asked about operating room scenes, Sarah Drew offered this:
We work with Bovine organs, which is cow's organs. The smell is repulsive and makes us all gag. And we use an actual soldering tool to solder the organs. It smells like burning flesh. There's also a lot of silicone and blood matter, red jello mixed with blood and chicken fat. It's pretty gross.[62]
Costumes are used to differentiate between attending surgeons, who wear navy blue scrubs, and residents, who wear light blue scrubs.[63] The series is filmed with a single-camera setup, as are many dramas.[64] Grey's Anatomy is often filmed using the "walk and talk" filming technique,[65] popularized on television by series such as St. Elsewhere, ER, and The West Wing.[66]
Series synopsis[edit]
Overview[edit]

Title screen
Grey's Anatomy follows the lives of surgical interns and residents at the fictional Grey-Sloan Memorial Hospital (formerly Seattle Grace Hospital, Season 1–6, Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital, Season 6–9, and then Grey-Sloan Memorial Hospital, Season 9–present), as they gradually evolve into seasoned doctors, with the help of their competent mentors. Every installment, typically, commences with a voice-over narrative from Meredith Grey or a season regular, foreshadowing the theme of the episode.[67][68] Each season tends to represent the physicians' academic year, with each completed year qualifying the residents at a level higher in the surgical field.[69] The season will always end with a finale, typically involving a tragic event such as a death or character departure.[70] Most installments revolve around the doctors' everyday lives as surgeons, but the show puts an emphasis on their personal, rather than professional, lives.[67] The series sets aside medical ethic concerns to focus on character development and relationships. Although the physicians treat the illnesses of their patients, often through complex surgeries, their primary motivation is customarily praise and competition.[71]
The residents initially arrive at the hospital each morning and argue over who will care for a certain patient.[72] A hospital superior is in charge of assigning cases, often translating to tense feelings between the residents and their superiors.[73] Episodes migrate back and forth from the doctors interacting with their patients, and with their co-workers. Once assigned a case, each doctordiagnoses the patient, with the help of his or her attending physician, which usually leads to surgery.[74] The surgeons tend to form personal connections with their patients, with a patient often conveying a message to his or her doctor, which unintentionally relates to the doctor's private life.[75] The show displays the growth of relationships between the doctors, either friendly or sexual, often stemming to a clash between their personal and professional lives. Emotional scenes are often accompanied by an indie rock background song, something that has become a hallmark of the series.[76] At the conclusion of each episode, one of the characters delivers another voice-over, typically contrasting or following up on their initial one.[68]

The five characters who are first introduced in the series premiere, as surgical interns, are Grey, Karev, O'Malley, Stevens, and Yang.[77] They are initially mentored by Bailey, a senior resident who becomes the hospital's Chief Resident,[78] and later an attending general surgeon, in season six.[79] The surgical program is initially headed by the Chief of Surgery, Richard Webber, who has a pre-existing personal relationship with Meredith, having had an affair with her mother when Meredith was a child. In Webber's employ are attending neurosurgeon Derek Shepherd, dubbed 'McDreamy' by the residents, and attending cardiothoracic surgeon Preston Burke. Shepherd is introduced as Meredith's love interest, while Burke begins a relationship with Yang.[80]
Introduced in the show's second season are obstetrician-gynecologist and neonatal surgeon, Addison Montgomery,[81] plastic surgeon Mark Sloan (nicknamed 'McSteamy' by the interns), from New York,[82] and orthopedic surgeon Callie Torres.[83] Montgomery is Shepherd's wife who arrives in Seattle seeking reconciliation with him,[84] Sloan is Shepherd's former best friend, who aided the breakdown of his marriage by having an affair with Montgomery,[85] while Torres is introduced as a love-interest, and eventual wife for O'Malley. The penultimate episode of season three introduces Lexie Grey, Meredith's half-sister who unexpectedly decides to pursue her internship at Seattle Grace Hospital after her mother's sudden death, and begins an on-again, off-again relationship with Sloan.[86] Burke and Yang, having been engaged,[87] endeavor to plan their wedding, while Montgomery departs the show at the conclusion of the third season, relocating to California, seeking a new life. The season three finale shows Burke's exit from the show, after leaving Yang at the altar on their wedding day.[88]

Reception[edit]
Critical response[edit]
"Grey’s Anatomy offers a different and perhaps more valuable idea of what it means to be strong: the capacity to suffer terribly, break down completely, and then get up again, confident that you’re bigger than the sum of the tragedies you’ve suffered—because everyone else is, too. The layers of history have grown pretty dense and rich, and the friendships that form around them as the characters suffer and survive is the glue of the series, and what—despite a few inevitable hit-or-miss patches—elevates it to something special."- Laura Hudson of Wired[172]
Grey's Anatomy has been well received among critics. The show holds an average of 71% positive score on Rotten Tomatoes and 7.7/10 score at IMDB site.[173] The A.V. Club gave an insight on both the overwhelming success and lows in the quality of the hit medical drama saying, "The quality arc for the show is all over the place, starting with a steady build in the first season, then skyrocketing into phenomenon in season two, then leveling off and dipping in season three, before having some seriously bumpy moments in seasons four (interrupted by the writers’ strike) and five. The climb begins again in season six"[174] Samantha Highfill ofEntertainment Weekly in a review wrote, " I believe the show’s best season to date is season 2. Let me make it clear that I’m not saying seasons 3 through 9 were bad. In my opinion, there have only been a few lulls in the show’s history, and most of them didn’t last a full season." adding, "I still enjoy the show, and I’ll honestly never stop watching. By any standards, Grey’s Anatomy has been successful television, ranking highly in the ratings for nine seasons and entering the cultural lexicon via phrases as cloying yet catchy as "McDreamy.", the show has had its periods of being intensely irritating, and it has had its periods when it seems as ifShonda Rhimes has taken leave of her faculties, but it’s also got an amazingly high batting average, particularly with every solid season that passes along in this second act of its run." The site lauded the show saying, "On average, it’s been very good TV, filled with interesting, driven characters who run the gamut of professions within the show’s hospital setting. It’s been, by turns, a goodsoap, a good romantic comedy, a good medical drama, and a good interpersonal show about an unexpected workplace family."[175]
The first season received positive reviews which steadily built up, with Gary Levin of USA Today calling Grey's Anatomy one of the top shows on television.[176] New York Daily News named Grey's Anatomy a "winner", whereas Newsday expressed a positive opinion by stating "You simply can't stop watching." The Washington Post's Tom Shales was critical of season one, finding it reminiscent of ER and commenting that: "The show is much more a matter of commercial calculation than an honest attempt to try something fresh and different."[177] Shortly after its initial airing, the Chicago Tribune's Maureen Ryan called Grey's Anatomy the new Friends; a concluded National Broadcasting Company (NBC) sitcom following the lives of a group of young adults, that all of its ten-year run in the top-five for viewer ratings.[3] The second season received critical acclaim, top critics like Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club called the show a "phenomenon" not just TV adding the show was, "one of the best TV shows around", Samantha Highfill of Entertainment Weekly later during the tenth season called the second "the show’s best season to date" however, Kevin Carr of 7M Picturesopined that Grey's Anatomy is a mere combination of Scrubs, ER, Sex and the City, and The Love Boat.[178] It further garnered positive reviews, Christopher Monfette of IGN Entertainment added: "The second season of this medical drama expertly wove its signature elements of complex relationships, whimsical banter and challenging life-lessons; all to a montage-fetish, indie-rock soundtrack."[179] Todd Gilchrist also from IGN called the season "terrific" adding, "Indeed, one of the best currently on television. While it remains to be seen what the creators do with it, now that it's become an outright event program, the season demonstrates that Rhimes and co. know what to do with the opportunities presented them. whether you're male or female, this is the kind of entertainment that small-screen devotees and folks fed up with television need to see."[180]

Ellen Pompeo has failed to garner a nomination at the Emmy Awards on multiple occasions.[181]
The title character of Grey's Anatomy, Meredith, has received both overwhelmingly positive and weary feedback by critics along the course of the show, with the development of the character garnering praise from majority critics. Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times referring to her as "the heroine of Grey's Anatomy".[182] BuddyTV praised the distinct uniqueness in the character calling Meredith an "unconventional heroine" adding, "From the very beginning Meredith Grey has been an unconventional heroine. Neither black nor white but always...wait for it...many shades of grey, she has always been, even in her lighter moments, dark and twisty."[183] When Pompeo did not receive an Emmy nomination for her work as Meredith, Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Timessuggested that Pompeo, "who has worked very hard and against all narrative odds to make Meredith Grey an interesting character", should have received a nomination at the 61st Primetime Emmy Awards, in 2009.[184] IGN's Monfette, less impressed, criticized her storyline as "some bizarrely under-developed sub-plot about depression and giving Derek a season's worth of reconsidering to do."[179] Robert Rorke of the New York Post was also critical of Meredith's role in the show, writing: "She used to be the queen of the romantic dilemmas, but lately, she's been a little dopey, what with the endless 'McDreamy' soliloquies."[185]Glenn Diaz of BuddyTV commented that "You gotta love Mer when she's gloomy." The development of the character has received praise from critics. Reviewing the first part of the eighth season, TV Fanatic wrote: "this season belongs to Meredith Grey. She is the heart and soul of the show and has been outstanding. This is a character that used to be so dark and twisty and has now grown into a more mature woman. Ellen Pompeo has been at the top of her game this season." Rick Porter reviewing the episode How to Save a Life from the eleventh season for Zap2it wrote, "Without Meredith, and without one of Pompeo's strongest performances in her long time on the show, "How to Save a Life" would have run the risk of coming across as a baldly manipulative death episode, the likes of which the show has done several times before. He added. "How to Save a Life" may not be the ideal Emmy-submission episode for Ellen Pompeo, considering Meredith is off screen for more than half of it. But it's among the best work she's ever done on the show."[186] Janalen Samson of BuddyTV lauded the Meredith's development throughout the series saying, "When one considers how this character has grown over eleven seasons, it really is amazing. Kudos to Ellen Pompeo for her fine work. She's actually done the impossible, because I actually care what happens to Meredith Grey."[183] Reviewing the season 12 premiere Sledgehammer critics including Alex Hawkins of the Western Gazette again highlighted Pompeo's due for an Emmy Award.
The majority of the supporting cast of Grey's Anatomy have been well received as well, with the New York Post's Rorke deeming Stevens to be "the heart and soul" of Grey's Anatomy, whereas Eyder Peralta of the Houston Chronicle was critical of her character development, stating: "[She's] the reason I don't watch Grey's Anatomy anymore."[187] Kelli Catana of The Huffington Postnamed Yang "the best damn character" and deemed "the Meredith/Yang relationship the most true friendship on network television."[188] Television Without Pity writer Lauren Shotwell claimed Yang is "the only one of these five [residents] that regularly acts like an actual doctor".[189] Analyzing Alex Karev Rachel Simon called him 'Underrated', she pointed out that Alex’s personal growth never seems to get acknowledged as "Alex has evolved, slowly and realistically, into a genuinely good person whose faults don’t miraculously disappear, but take a backseat to much better qualities."[190]Robert Bianco of USA Today said Dempsey has a "seemingly effortless way of humanizing Derek's 'dreamy' appeal with ego and vanity".[191] and his friendship with Mark Sloan has been well received Victor Balta said "they’ve demonstrated an easy chemistry that makes for some of the great comic relief around Seattle Grace Hospital."[192] While Addison Montgomery was deemed "sassy and bright and interesting."[193] TV Guide said of Walsh's stint on Grey's Anatomy: "She [Walsh] adds spice to an already hot show."[194] ortho surgeon Callie Torres after receiving mixed views earlier was praised for her bisexual storyline and critics further added that the character was anchored by stellar performance by Sara Ramirez.. Lexie Grey initially being criticized became a critics a favorite in the series Keen of The Trades wrote, "Chyler Leigh, does a fantastic job of making the progression feel seamless. Lexie steals the show as one of the best characters on the series."[195] With the departure of several cast members throughout the seasons, many new characters were added to the drama's ensemble. McKidd and Capshaw were referred to as "fresh additions" to the series, by Monfette of IGN.[196] In addition, Matt Roush of TV Guide commented: "Hunt/McKidd is the most encouraging thing to happen to Grey's Anatomy in quite a while."[197]Matt Mitovich of TV Guide noted that Robbins "quickly established herself as a fan favorite",[198] describing her as: "a breath of fresh air in the often angsty halls of Seattle Grace.[199] On April Kepner and Jackson Avery Courtney Morrison of TVFanatic wrote "April has grown since her character was introduced. She’s no longer much less annoying than she used to be, and she’s honest. A girl with principles is a girl you want to do well." and described her and Avery as "a couple for whom viewers can root". Speaking of the new cast members, in addition to the remaining original, Robert Bianco from USA Today called them the show's "best ensemble in years".[200]
Regarding season three, Bill Carter of The New York Times called Grey's Anatomy "television's hottest show", adding: "[No show] is expected to challenge Grey's Anatomy for prime-time pre-eminence."[201] Contrasting with Carter's view, Monfette of IGN said that it speedily found itself "mired in the annoying and absurd", adding: "This third season may very well represent a case of over-writing a concept that has, perhaps tragically, run bone-dry on narrative fuel."[179] At the conclusion of season three, Entertainment Weekly's Gregory Kirschling said "the show lacked a defining happy, warm-gooseflesh moment", adding that the season "didn't leave you dying for the [next] season premiere".[202] Speaking of the fourth season, Laura Burrows of IGN said the series became "a little more than mediocre, but less than fantastic", adding: "This season proved that even strong chemistry and good acting cannot save a show that suffers from the inevitable recycled plot."[203]
In contrast to the moderately negative feedback the third and fourth seasons received, Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said of the fifth season: "Overall, it feels more like the good old days thanGrey's Anatomy has in a long time." Misha Davenport from the Chicago Sun-Times said season five "hits on all the things the show does so well", adding: "There is romance, heartbreak, humor and a few moments that will move fans to tears."[204] Brian Lowry of Variety, less impressed, opinionated that the season five displayed the show running out of storylines.[205] Speaking of the sixth season, Bianco of USA Today wrote: "Grey's has always loved grand gestures. You like them or you don't; the only real question is whether the show pulls them off or it doesn't. This year, it did."[206]
The series has a score of 66 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on five reviews for season seven.[207] In response to the season, Bianco from USA Today commented: "Happily, it now seems to have landed on solid ground." Also of the seventh season, Entertainment Weekly's Jennifer Armstrong said: "It's in the shooting's emotional reverberations that the show is regenerating after the past few hit-and-miss seasons," whereas Verne Gay of Newsday commented: "Unfortunately, they've settled on far-too-easy and facile answers for the most part."[208] HitFix gave a positive review saying that, "season 7 overall has been one of the show's strongest ever." and added, "There was a time when Grey's Anatomy was this show where I suffered through a lot of stuff that made me cringe to get to those genius melodrama moments it could do so well. Over the last couple of years, it's evolved into a show that's much more consistent in tone, where it may not move me as often as it did in the early years but also very rarely makes me question my reasons for watching." [209] Speaking of season eight, Entertainment Weekly's Mandi Bierly called it a "so-so season",[210] and Lesley Goldberg of The Hollywood Reporter called it "emotional".[211] Also acknowledging the fan base Verne Gay of Newsday wrote "Grey's has had a good season and has an intensely loyal fan base to prove it." regarding the 8th season.[212]
The ninth season received more positive reviews, Rob Salem of Toronto Star called it "a solid return to form."[213] Brad Williams writing for What Culture praised the show's development over the season saying, "Grey's Anatomy has developed into a fine example of how a TV show can mature beyond its initial purpose." calling it "something almost anyone can watch and enjoy."[214] Praising the friendship between Cristina and Meredith of Entertainment Weekly wrote, "There's still one good reason to keep watching: Where else can you find such deep friendships between female co-workers".[215] The tenth season was also marked with praise, Annie Barrett for Entertainment Weekly wrote "There's true sorrow here along with the passion, which keeps their dynamic so intriguing to me."[216] Caroline Siede from The A.V. Club wrote in her review for the 10th season "At its best, Grey's Anatomy is about everyday bravery, sacrifice, and courage. At its worst, it's a melodramatic, moralizing soap opera. Both sides are on display as the show heads confidently into its 10th season."[217] Many sources, including Rachel Simon of Bustle and Nicole Pomarico of Wetpaint, claimed that Sandra Oh's performance during her final season on Grey's Anatomy is worthy of an Emmy nomination.[218][219]
Bryce Olin of Netflix ranked Grey's 9th among the 50 Best TV Shows on Netflix stating, "It’s a tough call, but based on Grey’s casting choices and revolutionary portrayals of female doctors in the series, I’m willing to argue that Grey’s Anatomy is the best medical drama of all time. Obviously, Shonda Rhimes didn’t reinvent the wheel with the series, but there’s no denying its popularity." adding, "I understand its significance in the pop culture sphere." He also stated that the show could go higher in the ranks with the upcoming season stating, "Apparently, Grey’s Anatomy fans are passionate about their show, although it seems like they’ve been closeted for the last few years. I’d love to move Grey’s Anatomy even higher on the ranking, but I’ll have wait until the 11th season comes to Netflix."[220][221]

— Brian Quick, University of Illinois[227]

Grey's Anatomy introduced the "mc-labeling" surge, ever since it dubbed Patrick Dempsey's character "McDreamy"
Grey's Anatomy has been considered an impact on culture by Entertainment Weekly's executive editor,Lori Majewski, with her writing: "Grey's Anatomy isn't just a show, it's a phenomenon. When [the] final shows air, every place in New York City is empty. You could get a table at the best restaurants."[228] The Daily Beast's Jace Lacob also considered the show an impact, comparing its success to that of Friends, and calling it a "cultural phenomenon".[229] Steve Sternberg, a media analyst with Magna Global USA explained that the show appeals to a broad audience, writing: "Roughly 80 percent of households during prime time only have one TV set on. People are looking for shows they can watch with other household members."[4] Grey's Anatomy introduced a "mc-labeling" surge, ever since it dubbed Dempsey's character "McDreamy". Canadian newspaper the National Post considers this trend a "phenomenon".[230]

Voices noted that the "mc-labeling" trend has been parodied on other shows including ERand Degrassi: The Next Generation.[231][unreliable source?] Mark Lawson of The Guardian has credited Grey's Anatomy with popularizing the "songtage", or musical montage segments.[76] Parodying this, MADtv created a spoof on the show in 2006, making fun of the series' emotional scenes including those accompanied by a musical montage.[232] The show's premise inspired the creation of A Corazón Abierto, a Colombian adaptation of Grey's Anatomy,[233] which in turn spawned a Mexican version of the same name.[234] A study conducted by the University of Western Sydney revealed that 94% of 400 polled medical students are regular viewers of Grey's Anatomy.[235] An additional study conducted by Brian Quick of the University of Illinois indicated that the show's portrayal of doctors being "smart, good looking, capable, and interesting", leads viewers to associating real-world doctors to be that way.[227]
Grey's has also been credited to have changed the perception on how good and bad television can be defined, The A.V. Club write, "Since The Sopranos burst onto the scene, we’ve too often classified a show as "good" based on how closely it adhered to the dark, violent, male-centric template set out by that particular show. It’s time for that to end. At its best, Grey’s has been among the very best shows on TV, and at its worst, it’s been at least fascinating to watch. To write it off is to unnecessarily narrow the definition of what good TV can be, to limit what the medium is capable of. TV is at its best when it emotionally connects, and even when it seems to be otherwise merrily hurtling off a cliff, Grey’s Anatomy is nothing but emotional connection, which is more than other, more consistently better shows can say."[174]
In 2011, a woman residing in Sheboygan, Wisconsin became unresponsive due to an asthma attack. Unable to wait for an ambulance, her daughter and a friend performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) on her, which they learned from Grey's Anatomy.[236] Despite this, Resident Karen Zink, M.D., deemed the show's portrayal of interns inaccurate, adding: "None of [the characters] have bags under their eyes. They all leave the hospital dressed cute, with their hair done and makeup on. That is so far away from the reality of interns. You are just dragging your butt, trying to stay alive. You don't have time to do your hair. You don't have time to put on makeup. Every surgical intern has bags under their eyes."[237] The series placed at No. 66 on Entertainment Weekly's "New TV Classics" list,[238] and was declared the third highest rated show for the first ten years of the Internet Movie Database (2002–2012).[239]
U.S. television ratings[edit]
Grey's Anatomy has received high viewership and ratings since its debut. The first four seasons of the program each ranked in the top ten among all viewers, reaching its peak Nielsen ratings in the second season, attracting an average of 19.44 million viewers per episode, and ranking at fifth place overall. Following the show's time-slot being relocated, overall rankings steadily declined, dropping below the top ten in its fifth season. Grey's Anatomy made its greatest fall from its sixth to seventh season, slipping from seventeenth place to thirty-first. The series is on a steady decline in terms of overall viewership and rankings, yet Grey's Anatomy still holds value in charts when numbers are pulled from the digital video recorder (DVR). It was the most recorded show between 2007 and 2011, based on cumulative totals, and has been for several years in a row.[240]
The most-watched episode of the series is "It's the End of the World", with 37.88 million viewers, aided by a lead-in from Super Bowl XL.[241] In 2011, Grey's Anatomy was named the fourth-highest revenue earning show of the year, with US$2.67 million per half hour, behind Desperate Housewives, Two and a Half Men, and American Idol at the top.[242] In 2012, the show was the fifth-highest revenue earning show of the year, with US$2.75 million per half hour, behind Glee, Two and a Half Men, The X Factor (U.S.) and American Idol.[243] While Grey's Anatomy is no longer ranked in the top numbers for overall ratings, the show's ranking in the key 18–49 demographic has remained high. As of season eight, the series is the highest-rated drama on television in the target demographic.[244] Below is a table of Grey's Anatomy's seasonal rankings in the U.S. television market, based on average total viewers per episode. Each U.S. network television season starts in September and ends in late May, which coincides with the completion of May sweeps.

The cast of Grey's Anatomy was displeased with the network's decision to center the spin-off onKate Walsh's character
On February 21, 2007, The Wall Street Journal reported that ABC was pursuing a spin-off medical drama television series for Grey's Anatomy featuring Walsh's character, Montgomery.[34] Subsequent reports confirmed the decision, stating that an expanded two-hour broadcast of Grey's Anatomy would serve as abackdoor pilot for the proposed spin-off. The cast of Grey's Anatomy was reportedly unhappy about the decision, as all hoped the spin-off would have been given to them. Pompeo commented that she felt, as the star, she should have been consulted,[334] and Heigl disclosed that she had hoped for a spin-off for Stevens.[335] The backdoor pilot that aired on May 3, 2007 sees Montgomery take a leave of absence from Seattle Grace Hospital, to visit her best friend from Los Angeles, Naomi Bennett (Merrin Dungey, later Audra McDonald), a reproductive endocrinology and infertility specialist. While in Los Angeles, she meets Bennett's colleagues at the Oceanside Wellness Center.[119] The two-hour broadcast entitled "The Other Side of This Life" served as the twenty-second and twenty-third episodes of the third season, and was directed by Michael Grossman, according to Variety.[336] The cast included Amy Brenneman, Paul Adelstein,Tim Daly, Taye Diggs, Chris Lowell, and Merrin Dungey.[337]
KaDee Strickland's character, Charlotte King, who would be introduced in the spin-off's first season premiere, did not appear in the backdoor pilot. Her addition to the main cast was announced on July 11, 2007, prior to the commencement of the first season.[338] She did not have to audition for the role, but was cast after a meeting with Rhimes.[339] Also not present in the backdoor pilot was McDonald, due to her character, Naomi Bennett, being portrayed by a different actress, Merrin Dungey. However, on June 29, 2007, ABC announced that Dungey would be replaced, with no reason given for the change.[340] The drama was titled Private Practice, and its premiere episode followed the second part of the season debut of Dancing with the Stars, and provided a lead-in to fellow freshman series Dirty Sexy Money. Pushing Daisies, a third new series for the evening, rounded out the lineup as a lead-in to Private Practice.[314] The series ended its run in January 2013 after six seasons.[341][342]
Grey's Anatomy had three crossover storylines with Private Practice.
