* Hunter × Hunter: The Last Mission (2013) Anime and Manga portalHunter × Hunter (Japanese: ????×???? Hepburn: Hant? Hant??, stylized as HUNTER×HUNTER) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Yoshihiro Togashi. It has been serialized in Weekly Sh?nen Jumpmagazine since March 3, 1998, although the manga has frequently gone on extended hiatuses since 2006. As of June 2016, 350 chapters have been collected into 33 volumes by Shueisha. The story focuses on a young boy named Gon Freecss, who discovers that his father, who he was told was dead, is actually alive and a world-renowned Hunter, a licensed profession for those who specialize in fantastic pursuits such as locating rare or unidentified animal species, treasure hunting, surveying unexplored enclaves, or hunting down lawless individuals. Despite being abandoned by his father, Gon departs upon a journey to follow in his footsteps, pass the rigorous Hunter Examination, and eventually find his father. Along the way, Gon meets various other Hunters and also encounters the paranormal. The original inspiration for the manga came from Togashi's own collecting hobby.
In 1999, Hunter × Hunter was adapted into a 62-episode anime television series produced by Nippon Animation and directed by Kazuhiro Furuhashi. The show premiered on Japan's Fuji TV and ran until 2001. Three separate original video animations (OVAs) totaling 30 episodes were subsequently produced by Nippon Animation and released in Japan from 2002 to 2004. A second anime television series by Madhouse aired on Nippon Television from October 2011 to September 2014, with two animated theatrical films released in 2013. There are also numerous audio albums, video games, musicals, and other media based on Hunter × Hunter. The manga has been translated into English and released in North America by Viz Media since April 2005. Both television series were also licensed by Viz, with the first series having aired on the Funimation Channel in 2009 and the second series airing on Adult Swim's Toonami block since April 16, 2016.
Hunter × Hunter has been a huge critical and financial success and has become one of Shueisha's best-selling manga series, having sold over 65.8 million copies in Japan alone as of February 2013.[1]

Plot[edit]
Main article: List of Hunter × Hunter characters
The story follows a young boy named Gon Freecss who was told all his life that both his parents were dead, but when he learns from Kite, an apprentice of his father, Ging Freecss that he is still alive and has since become an accomplished Hunter, Gon leaves his home on Whale Island (???? Kujira Shima?) and take the Hunter Examination (?????? Hant? Shiken?) in order to become a Hunter like him.[2][3][4] During the exam, Gon meets and eventually befriends three of the other applicants: Kurapika, the last remaining member of the Kurta clan who wishes to become a Hunter in order to avenge his clan and recover their scarlet-glowing eyes, plucked from their corpses by a band of thieves known as the Phantom Troupe; Leorio, a prospective physician who, in order to pay for medical school, desires the financial benefits Hunters receive; and Killua Zoldyck, another twelve-year-old boy who has left his former life as a member of the world's most notorious assassin family.[3][4][5] Among many other examinees, Gon continuously encounters Hisoka, a mysterious and deadly transmuter who takes an interest in him. After passing by many trials together, Gon and his friends end up passing the exam except for Killua who fails after killing another applicant out of frustration and runs away to his family's estate in shame.
After Gon and the others convince Killua to rejoin their side, Leorio and Kurapika depart temporarily for their own personal reasons, while Gon and Killua set for the Heavens Arena (????? Tenk? T?gij??), a skyscraper where thousands of martial artists compete daily in fighting tournaments, seeking to improve themselves, and gain monetary rewards.[6] There they meet a kung fu master named Wing, who trains them in utilizing Nen, a Qi-like life energy used by its practicers to manifest parapsychological abilities, and also considered to be the final requirement to pass the Hunter Exam. Some time later, Gon and his friends reunite again in Yorknew City (???????? Y?kushin Shiti?)where they have a clash with the Phantom Troupe. In the occasion, some members of the band of thieves are killed and Kurapika is forced to give up the chance of hunting down the rest to rescue Gon and Killua, who were captured by them, but not without succeeding to seal the powers of their leader, Chrollo Lucilfer.
A few days later, Gon and Killua achieve their objective of start playing Greed Island, an extremely rare and expensive video game with Nen-like properties following some clues about Ging's whereabouts.[7] While exploring the game, it is revealed that its scenario is actually set somewhere in the real world, created with nen by no other than Ging himself. Outclassed by the difficulty of the challenges in the game at first, they are soon joined and trained by Biscuit Krueger, an experienced teacher of Nen and kung fu master and after Killua takes a short break to apply for the Hunter Examination again, this time with success, the trio complete the game together against all odds and Gon obtains the right to choose the artifacts from the game necessary to reunite with his father.
However, Gon decides to have Killua accompany him to meet his father, and the artifacts send them to meet Kite instead. The duo then decide to help with Kite's research, and upon discovering a giant insect limb, the group discover it came from a man-sized Chimera Ant queen, an insect that devours other creatures and then gives birth to progeny that inherit the characteristics of the different species it has eaten. The queen washes up onto an island nation called the Neo-Green Life (N.G.L.) Autonomous Region, where she quickly develops a taste for humans and builds a colony powerful enough to overcome the population, specially when its offsprings learn the power of Nen after consuming some Hunters. Upon facing the Chimera Ants, Kite sacrifices himself to allow Gon and Killua to flee and alert the Hunter Association. After months of preparation, the Association sends a team of some of their most powerful Hunters, including Netero, the president of the Association himself, to defeat the Ants and their king, Meruem, whose subjects secretly overthrew the government of the nearby Republic of East Gorteau (?????????) as part of their plan of subduing all of mankind. Despite losing to Meruem in combat, Netero ends up killing him with a bomb implanted in his body that poisons him to death soon after. In the occasion, Gon has a showdown with Neferpitou, the Ant who killed Kite, and despite having enacted his revenge, is hospitalized and in critical condition.
After the Chimera Ant incident is resolved, the Hunter Association's top echelons, the Zodiacs, from which Ging is a member, begin the process of choosing Netero's replacement as Chairman, while Killua returns home to ask for his younger sister Alluka to save Gon's life. However, his family is unwilling to risk losing Alluka or having her dangerous powers used against them, but after evading his older brother Illumi's attempts to intercept him, Killua manages to bring Alluka to Gon's side and have him fully recovered, before sealing her powers completely to ensure she can have a normal life. Killua then parts ways with Gon, as he wants to travel with Alluka who had never seen the outside world before, while Gon himself finally meets his father and learns the true nature of his quest.
Some time later, Netero's son, Beyond, assembles an expedition to the Dark Continent (???? Ankoku Tairiku?), the forbidden, vast area outside of the known world, sponsored by the Kingdom of Kakin. Fearing that the expedition may bring disaster to the world, just like it occurred in previous attempts, the world's five greatest powers accept that Kakin join their ranks in exchange for full authority over its findings. To accompany Beyond and prevent him from doing something unexpected, the Zodiacs decide to watch over him, inviting Kurapika and Leorio to join them, replacing Ging and the former Vice-Chairman Pariston, who assembled their own team by Beyond's request.
Setting[edit]
Hunters (???? Hant??) are licensed, elite members of humanity who are capable of tracking down secret treasures, rare beasts, or even other individuals.[5] To obtain a license one must pass the rigorous annual Hunter Examination run by the Hunter Association, which has a success rate of less than one in a hundred-thousand.[8] A Hunter may be awarded up to three stars; a single star for making "remarkable achievements in a particular field"; they may then be upgraded to two stars for "holding an official position" and mentoring another Hunter up to single star level; and finally upgraded to three stars for "remarkable achievements in multiple fields."[9]
Nen (?) is the ability to control one's own life energy or aura, which is constantly emitted from them whether they know it or not. There are four basic Nen techniques; Ten (?) maintains the aura in the body, strengthening it for defense, Zetsu (?) shuts the aura flow off, useful for concealing one's presence and relieving fatigue, Ren (?) enables a user to produce more Nen, and Hatsu (?) is a person's specific use of Nen.[10] Nen users are classified into six types based on their Hatsu abilities; Enhancers (??? Ky?kakei) strengthen and reinforce their natural physical abilities, Emitters (??? H?shutsukei) project aura out of their bodies, Manipulators (??? S?sakei) control objects or living things, Transmuters (??? Henkakei) change the type or properties of their aura, Conjurers (???? Gugenkakei) create objects out of their aura, and Specialists (??? Tokushitsukei) have unique abilities that do not fall into the previous categories.[11] A Nen user can enter into a Contract (?? Seiyaku) whereby pledging to follow certain Limitations (?? Seiyaku), their abilities are strengthened in relation to how strict they are. An example of this is Kurapika who, in order to have an unbreakable chain that will hold members of the Phantom Troupe no matter what, offered his life should he use it on anyone other than its members.[12]
Production[edit]
Author Yoshihiro Togashi explained that one of his hobbies is collecting objects of all sorts, so he was inspired to create a manga involving collecting titled "Hunter".[13] He came up with the final name Hunter × Hunter while watching the television variety show Downtown, in which the hosts often repeated what they said to make the audience laugh.[13] The "×" in the title is silent.[14] As with his previous series, YuYu Hakusho, Togashi used drafting ink and Kabura pens for his illustrations but began using an eMac to color them.[15] Togashi uses few or no assistants in the manga's production;[16] however, fellow manga artist and future wife Naoko Takeuchi assisted Togashi in adding screentone to single-color pages for the first volume.[17][18] With the birth of their first son early in its publication, Togashi felt that this personal aspect of his life would be a great influence on his work, particularly the manga's theme of a young boy searching for his father.[15]
There have been several instances in which Togashi has apologized to readers in Shueisha's Weekly Sh?nen Jump for low quality artwork and promised to redraw portions of the chapters for their tank?bon (collected volume) releases.[19][20][21] In addition, the publication history of the Hunter × Hunter manga has been plagued with hiatuses, in which serialized chapters would be separated by extended periods of time.[22][23][24] After returning from a two-year-long hiatus in June 2014,[25]and joining the English language Weekly Shonen Jump lineup, the manga went on its most recent hiatus just two months later.[26] The series returned from this hiatus, which has been its longest to date, on April 18, 2016.[27] After this return for some time over two months, the series has resumed its hiatus.

The company published one volume per month for a total of six volumes, covering up to the end of the Greed Island story arc.[30] In December 2012, Togashi wrote a two-part manga titled Kurapika Tsuioku-hen (????????, "Kurapika Recollection") to act as a prequel to the first animated film.[31] Tokyo Ghoul author Sui Ishida created a 69-page storyboard of a manga chapter depicting the past of Hunter × Hunter's Hisoka.

Original video animations[edit]
Main article: List of Hunter × Hunter OVA episodes
When the Hunter × Hunter anime covered most of its source material by 2001, Nippon Animation made the decision to end the adaptation rather than continue it with filler.[50] Due to fans' unsatisfied reactions to the conclusion of the television series, three subsequent OVAs were produced by Nippon Animation. These carried the plot from where the broadcast left off during the Yorknew City arc and covered the Greed Island arc.[51][52][53][54][55] The first OVA series was directed by Satoshi Saga and ran for eight episodes in four released volumes from January 17 to April 17, 2002.[56] The second OVA series, Hunter × Hunter: Greed Island, was directed by Yukihiro Matsushita and ran for eight episodes in four released volumes from February 19 to May 21, 2003.[57] The third OVA series, Hunter × Hunter: G.I. Final, was directed by Makoto Sato and ran for 14 episodes in seven released volumes from March 3 to August 18, 2004.[58] After the original anime's initial run on Animax, the OVAs were aired successively.[42][59] Viz has shown no intention of releasing English versions of the OVAs.[60]
Second series (2011)[edit]
Main article: List of Hunter × Hunter (2011) episodes

Reception[edit]
Manga reception[edit]
The Hunter × Hunter manga has been largely commercially successful; having sold over 60.5 million collected volumes in Japan as of February 2012, making it Shueisha's eighth best-selling manga series.[108] This number had grown to 65.8 million copies by February 2013.[1] Several individual volumes have been some of the best-selling manga in Japan during their release week; such as volumes 25 through 29.[109][110][111][112][113] Volumes 24 and 27 were some of the top-selling volumes for their respective years.[114][115] Hunter × Hunter was the eighth best-selling manga series of both 2012 and 2013, with 3.4 and 4.6 million copies sold those years respectively.[116][117] In North America, volumes 23 through 27 have ranked within the top 300 best-selling graphics novels list of sales estimates by Diamond Comic Distributors.[118][119][120][121][122]
The Hunter × Hunter manga has received much praise for its plot and characters. Jason Thompson, author of Manga: The Complete Guide, described its storyline as "an almost random collection of psych-outs, battles, puzzles, and trickery" that works on both a chapter-by-chapter basis and a larger scale.[16] Thompson elaborated that with all the goals and subplots of each of the main characters, the story could seemingly go on forever, despite being unpredictable enough to hold reader interest.[16] Charles Solomon, a writer for The New York Times and Los Angeles Times, admired the moral seriousness of Gon, a quality that gives the protagonist "an appeal his relentlessly upbeat counterparts lack".[123][124] Publishers Weekly gave a positive review to the first volume of the manga, stating that Togashi "shows a deft touch" with its standard story, calling his artwork "clear and graceful", and mentioning that his characters are "endearing and complex".[125]While Rika Takahashi of EX.org and Claude J. Pelletier of Protoculture Addicts found the art style in Hunter × Hunter to be much simpler than Togashi's two previous serializations, Level E and YuYu Hakusho, both reviewers appreciated the intricate narrative and characters.[3][5]
Anime reception[edit]
1999 series[edit]
The first Hunter × Hunter anime series has enjoyed much more modest popularity than its manga source. Newtype listed it as having a Japanese television rating of 10.5 for the fourth quarter of 2000.[126] The show's viewership was ranked number six among the top ten anime television series in Japan for February 2001.[127]The series was voted as the 16th best anime of 2000 in the Animage Anime Grand Prix, but rose to fourth place the following year.[128][129] In 2001, the staff of the magazine listed Hunter × Hunter as the 94th most important anime of all time.[130] In a 2006 web poll conducted in Japan by the network TV Asahi, the Hunter × Hunter television series was voted 28th best anime of all time.[131] In 2010, Mania.com's Briana Lawrence listed Hunter × Hunter at number nine of the website's "10 Anime Series That Need a Reboot".[132]
Critical reception for the first Hunter × Hunter television adaptation has been generally favorable. Miyako Matsuda of Protoculture Addicts, Carl Kimlinger of the Anime News Network (ANN), and Derrick L. Tucker of THEM Anime Reviews all expressed positive views of the series' narrative and characters.[5][39][133] Matsuda admired the adventure-filled world of Hunter × Hunter and the practical character qualities of friendship, effort, and victory inserted by Togashi.[5] Beginning with the second Viz DVD volume, Kimlinger summarized, "Togashi's plotting is canny and occasionally insightful and Furuhashi's visuals inventive yet attuned to the measured pacing of the series. Together they create a shonen action series that is both fun to watch and curiously respectful of its audience's intelligence. A strange combination indeed."[39] Tucker admitted to being "bewitched" by the series mainly due to the remarkable and original characters, especially the interplay between the vastly different personalities of the Phantom Troupe members.[133] Kimlinger gave particular praise to the characteristics of the complex villain Hisoka and the deep, emotional transformation of Kurapika in the latter half of the series.[6][7][39] Theron Martin, also of ANN, contrastingly found the plot of the earliest episodes to be cliché, called the protagonist Gon "an obvious Son Goku derivative", and stated that many of the story's aspects have already been covered by other sh?nenseries such as Dragon Ball Z a decade earlier. Martin was also displeased by an alleged lack of character development on the main protagonists' parts in the initial episodes.[4]
The art and animation of the Hunter × Hunter anime have also been commended by the press. Kimlinger and Tucker were impressed by the art direction of Hunter × Hunter, the former of whom critiquing the adaptation of Togashi's work by Furuhashi as having "understated energy and flair, making the most of the era's (1999) mix of traditional and CG animation to bring Gon and friends' physical feats to fluid, exhilarating life."[39][133] Martin faulted both the artwork and the subtle differences in character design. "The artistry not only shows its age but, in fact, looks older than it actually is," the reviewer commented, "hearkening back to a day when digital coloring and CG enhancements were not ubiquitous and allowances for a rougher look were greater." Opinions of the series' sound and music have been somewhat mixed. Martin positively noted the soundtrack as the strongest production point of Hunter × Hunter, and was satisfied with both the English translation of the script and Ocean's voice overs.[4] Tucker found the music satisfactory and improved as the series progressed, but did not think it lived up to its potential.[133] Kimlinger agreeably felt the musical score to be appropriate in most instances, but criticized the English dub as "a letdown since day one".[6][7]
2011 series[edit]
Madhouse's 2011 adaptation has been met with near universal critical acclaim. While the series as a whole has received widespread praise,[134][135] the Chimera Ant arc in particular has been often singled out. In addition to being met with rave reviews, the arc has generated considerable discussion and analysis of its themes, symbols, characters and structure throughout and in the aftermath of its run. The arc is commonly viewed as a deconstruction of sh?nen and action anime;[136][137]other readings have focused on supposed symbolic parallels with Buddhism[138][139] and nuclear war. Nick Creamer compared the arc to a “war drama”. In a lengthy essay, Creamer read the arc as a study of, and in the end a simultaneous critique and defense of human nature.[140]
Much of the writing surrounding the arc focuses on its villain, the Chimera Ant King. Largely echoing Creamer’s conclusion, Luke Halliday, in an examination of the character, describes his story as “an exploration into what it means to be human.”[141] In the piece, Halliday describes the King's development as “one of the most interesting and captivating in anime . . . [the King's] journey is simply unforgettable” and states his own belief that the arc “will go down as one of the greatest stories told in anime”.
Nick Creamer held similar sentiments, writing “the show’s fantastic aesthetics elevate it above almost everything out there – in direction, in sound design, in pacing, in animation, in basically every relevant aesthetic metric, Hunter x Hunter triumphs. That it’s been maintaining this level of quality for well over a hundred episodes is nothing short of astonishing.”[142]
