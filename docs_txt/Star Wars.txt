* Star Wars LandStar Wars is an American epic space opera franchise, centered on a film series created by George Lucas. It depicts the adventures of various characters "a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away".
The franchise began in 1977 with the release of the film Star Wars (subtitled Episode IV: A New Hope in 1981[2][3]), by 20th Century Fox, which became a worldwide pop culture phenomenon. It was followed by the similarly successful sequels The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983); these three films constitute the original Star Wars trilogy (Episodes IV–VI). A prequel trilogy (Episodes I–III) was later released between 1999 and 2005, which received a more mixed reaction from critics and fans in comparison to the original trilogy. More recently, a sequel trilogy (Episodes VII–IX) began with the release of Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015). All seven films were nominated for or won Academy Awards, and were commercial successes, with a combined box office revenue of $6.46 billion,[4] making Star Wars the fourth highest-grossing film series.[5] Additional theatrical films outside of the main saga include the animated Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008) and an upcoming series of anthology films, which will begin with the release of Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016).
The series has spawned an extensive media franchise—the Star Wars expanded universe—including books, television series, computer and video games, and comic books, resulting in significant development of the series's fictional universe. Star Wars also holds a Guinness World Records title for the "Most successful film merchandising franchise." In 2012, the total value of the Star Wars franchise was estimated at USD $30.7 billion, including box-office receipts as well as profits from their video games and DVD sales.[6]
In 2012, The Walt Disney Company acquired Lucasfilm for $4.06 billion and earned the distribution rights to all subsequent Star Wars films, beginning with the release of The Force Awakens in 2015.[7] 20th Century Fox retains the physical distribution rights to the first two Star Wars trilogies, owning permanent rights for the original 1977 film and holding the rights to Episodes I–III, V and VI until May 2020.[8][9] Walt Disney Studiosowns digital distribution rights to all the Star Wars films, excluding A New Hope.[9][10]

The events depicted in the Star Wars franchise take place in a fictional galaxy. Many species of alien creatures (often humanoid) are depicted. Robotic droids are also commonplace and are generally built to serve their owners. Space travel is common, and many planets in the galaxy are members of a single galactic government. In the prequel trilogy, this is depicted in the form of the Galactic Republic; at the end of the prequel trilogy and throughout the original trilogy, this government is the Galactic Empire. Preceding and during the sequel trilogy, this government is the New Republic.
One of the prominent elements of Star Wars is "the Force", an omnipresent energy that can be harnessed by those with that ability, known as Force-sensitives. It is described in the first produced film as "an energy field created by all living things [that] surrounds us, penetrates us, [and] binds the galaxy together."[11] The Force allows users to perform various supernatural feats (such as telekinesis, clairvoyance, precognition, and mind control) and can amplify certain physical traits, such as speed and reflexes; these abilities vary between characters and can be improved through training. While the Force can be used for good, known as the light side, it also has a dark side that, when pursued, imbues users with hatred, aggression, and malevolence.
The seven films feature the Jedi, who adhere to the light side of the Force to serve as peacekeepers and guardians, and the Sith, who use the dark side of the Force for evil in an attempt to destroy the Jedi Order and the Republic and rule the galaxy for themselves.
Theatrical films
The first film in the series, Star Wars, was released on May 25, 1977. This was followed by two sequels: The Empire Strikes Back, released on May 21, 1980, and Return of the Jedi, released on May 25, 1983. The opening crawl of the sequels disclosed that they were numbered as "Episode V" and "Episode VI" respectively, though the films were generally advertised solely under their subtitles. Though the first film in the series was simply titled Star Wars, with its 1981 re-release it had the subtitle Episode IV: A New Hope added to remain consistent with its sequel, and to establish it as the middle chapter of a continuing saga.[12]
In 1997, to correspond with the 20th anniversary of the original film, Lucas released a "Special Edition" of the Star Wars trilogy to theaters. The re-release featured alterations to the three films, primarily motivated by the improvement of CGI and other special effects technologies, which allowed visuals that were not possible to achieve at the time of the original filmmaking. Lucas continued to make changes to the films for subsequent releases, such as the first ever DVD release of the original trilogy on September 21, 2004, and the first ever Blu-ray release of all six films on September 16, 2011.[13] Reception of the Special Edition was mixed,[14][15][16][17] prompting petitions and fan edits to produce restored copies of the original trilogy.[18][19]
More than two decades after the release of the original film, the series continued with a prequel trilogy; consisting of Episode I: The Phantom Menace, released on May 19, 1999; Episode II: Attack of the Clones, released on May 16, 2002; and Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, released on May 19, 2005.[20] On August 15, 2008, Star Wars: The Clone Wars was released theatrically as a lead-in to the animated TV series of the same name. Star Wars: The Force Awakens was released on December 18, 2015.
On September 14, 2016, Turner acquired the broadcast rights to the eleven Star Wars movies.[21][22][23]

The original trilogy begins with the Galactic Empire nearing completion of the Death Star space station, which will allow the Empire to crush the Rebel Alliance, an organized resistance formed to combat Emperor Palpatine's tyranny. Palpatine's Sith apprentice Darth Vader captures Princess Leia, a member of the rebellion who has stolen the plans to the Death Star and hidden them in the astromech droid R2-D2. R2, along with his protocol droid counterpart C-3PO, escapes to the desert planet Tatooine. There, the droids are purchased by farm boy Luke Skywalker and his step-uncle and aunt. While Luke is cleaning R2, he accidentally triggers a message put into the droid by Leia, who asks for assistance from the legendary Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi. Luke later assists the droids in finding the exiled Jedi, who is now passing as an old hermit under the alias Ben Kenobi. When Luke asks about his father, whom he has never met, Obi-Wan tells him that Anakin Skywalker was a great Jedi who was betrayed and murdered by Vader.[26]Obi-Wan and Luke hire the smuggler Han Solo and his Wookiee co-pilot Chewbacca to take them to Alderaan, Leia's home world, which they eventually find has been destroyed by the Death Star. Once on board the space station, Luke and Han rescue Leia while Obi-Wan allows himself to be killed during a lightsaber duel with Vader; his sacrifice allows the group to escape with the plans that help the Rebels destroy the Death Star. Luke himself (guided by the power of the Force) fires the shot that destroys the deadly space station during the Battle of Yavin.[11]
Three years later, Luke travels to find the Jedi Master Yoda, now living in exile on the swamp-infested world of Dagobah, to begin his Jedi training. However, Luke's training is interrupted when Vader lures him into a trap by capturing Han and his friends at Cloud City. During a fierce lightsaber duel, Vader reveals that he is Luke's father and attempts to turn him to the dark side of the Force.[27] Luke escapes and, after rescuing Han from the gangster Jabba the Hutt, returns to Yoda to complete his training; only to find the 900-year-old Jedi Master on his deathbed. Before he dies, Yoda confirms that Vader is Luke's father. Moments later, the Force ghost of Obi-Wan tells Luke that he must confront his father once again before he can become a Jedi, and that Leia is his twin sister.
As the Rebels attack the second Death Star, Luke engages Vader in another lightsaber duel as the Emperor watches; both Sith Lords intend to turn Luke to the dark side and take him as their apprentice. During the duel, Luke succumbs to his anger and brutally overpowers Vader, but controls himself at the last minute; realizing that he is about to suffer his father's fate, he spares Vader's life and proudly declares his allegiance to the Jedi. An enraged Palpatine then attempts to kill Luke with Force lightning, a sight that moves Vader to turn and kill the Emperor, suffering mortal wounds in the process. After thanking Luke for bringing him back to the light side, Anakin Skywalker dies in his son's arms while the Rebels succeed in destroying the second Death Star.[28]
Prequel trilogy summary
The prequel trilogy begins 32 years before the original film, with the corrupt Trade Federation setting up a blockade of battleships around the planet Naboo. The Sith Lord Darth Sidious had secretly planned the blockade to give his alter ego, Senator Palpatine, a pretense to overthrow and replace the Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic. At the Chancellor's request, the Jedi Knight Qui-Gon Jinn and his apprentice, a younger Obi-Wan Kenobi, are sent to Naboo to negotiate with the Federation. However, the two Jedi are forced to instead help the Queen of Naboo, Padmé Amidala, escape from the blockade and plead her planet's crisis before the Republic Senate on Coruscant. When their starship is damaged during the escape, they land on Tatooine for repairs, where Qui-Gon discovers a nine-year-old Anakin Skywalker. Qui-Gon comes to believe that Anakin is the "Chosen One" foretold by Jedi prophecy to bring balance to the Force, and he helps liberate the boy from slavery so that he can be trained as a Jedi. The Jedi Council, led by Yoda, suspects Anakin possesses too much fear and anger within him, but reluctantly allows Obi-Wan to train the boy after Qui-Gon is killed by Palpatine's first apprentice, Darth Maul, during the Battle of Naboo.[29]
Ten years later, the Jedi Order becomes involved in the Clone Wars between the armies of the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, which Palpatine secretly engineers to destroy the Jedi Order and lure Anakin into his service.[30] At the same time, Anakin and Padmé fall in love and secretly wed, and eventually Padmé becomes pregnant. Anakin has a prophetic vision of Padmé dying in childbirth, and Palpatine convinces him that the dark side of the Force holds the power to save her life. Desperate, Anakin submits to Palpatine's Sith teachings and is renamed Darth Vader.
While Palpatine re-organizes the Republic into the tyrannical Empire, Vader participates in the extermination of the Jedi Order, culminating in a lightsaber duel between himself and Obi-Wan on the volcanic planet Mustafar. Obi-Wan defeats his former apprentice and friend, severing his limbs and leaving him to burn to death on the shores of a lava flow. Palpatine arrives shortly afterward and saves Vader by placing him into a mechanical black mask and suit of armor that serves as a permanent life support system. At the same time, Padmé dies while giving birth to twins Luke and Leia. Obi-Wan and Yoda, now the only remaining Jedi alive, agree to separate the twins and keep them hidden from both Vader and the Emperor; until the time comes when Anakin's children can be used to help overthrow the Empire.[31]
Sequel trilogy summary
Approximately 30 years after the destruction of the second Death Star, Luke Skywalker, the last Jedi, has vanished. The First Order has risen from the fallen Empireand seeks to destroy Luke and the New Republic, while the Resistance, a small force backed by the Republic and led by the former princess of Alderaan, General Leia Organa, opposes them. On the planet Jakku, Resistance pilot Poe Dameron obtains a map that leads to Luke's location. Stormtroopers under the command of Kylo Ren, the son of Han Solo and Leia, capture Poe. His droid BB-8 escapes with the map and encounters a scavenger, Rey. Ren tortures Poe and learns of BB-8. Stormtrooper FN-2187 finds himself unable to kill for the First Order, and he frees Poe. The two escape in a TIE fighter; Poe dubs FN-2187 "Finn". They crash on Jakku, and Poe appears to die in the process. Finn encounters Rey and BB-8, but the First Order locates them, so they escape the planet in a stolen ship: the Millennium Falcon. After leaving Jakku, the Falcon is recaptured by Han Solo and Chewbacca, who have stepped away from the Resistance and resumed their lives as smugglers. The five companions travel to Takodana to meet with Maz Kanata. While there, Rey finds the lightsaber that previously belonged Anakin and Luke Skywalker, and upon touching it, brushes with the Force. Maz's castle is attacked by the First Order. Finn, Han, and Chewbacca are saved by a group of Resistance pilots led by Poe, who survived the crash on Jakku, but Rey is captured by Ren and taken to Starkiller Base. After reuniting with Leia and the Resistance on D'Qar, Han, Finn, and Chewbacca travel to Starkiller Base to free Rey and disable the planet's shields, which will allow Resistance pilots to destroy it. Rey is tortured by Ren, but her Force sensitivity allows her to resist him. She escapes by using a Jedi mind trick on her guard and reunites with Han, Finn, and Chewbacca, but the group encounters Ren. Han confronts his son, calling him by his birth name, Ben Solo, and asking him to come home. Ren momentarily appears to be swayed towards the light side, but then ignites his lightsaber and kills Han. Resistance pilots begin to bombard the base. Finn and Rey escape the base and encounter Ren. Finn takes up Anakin's lightsaber, only to be badly wounded by Ren. Rey Force pulls the lightsaber to her, and fights and wounds Ren, but the two are separated by a rift. Rey, Finn, and Chewbacca escape the imploding planet on the Falcon and return to the Resistance. A wounded Finn stays on D'Qar, while Rey, Chewbacca, and R2-D2 use the map to find Luke Skywalker on the planet Ahch-To, where Rey presents a silent Luke with his old lightsaber.
Production history
Original trilogy
"Original trilogy" redirects here. For the video game, see Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy.

George Lucas, the creator of Star Wars
In 1971, Universal Studios agreed to make American Graffiti and Star Wars in a two-picture contract, although Star Warswas later rejected in its early concept stages. American Graffiti was completed in 1973 and, a few months later, Lucas wrote a short summary called "The Journal of the Whills", which told the tale of the training of apprentice CJ Thorpe as a "Jedi-Bendu" space commando by the legendary Mace Windy.[32] Frustrated that his story was too difficult to understand, Lucas then began writing a 13-page treatment called The Star Wars on April 17, 1973, which had thematic parallels with Akira Kurosawa's The Hidden Fortress.[33] By 1974, he had expanded the treatment into a rough draft screenplay, adding elements such as the Sith, the Death Star, and a protagonist named Annikin Starkiller.
For the second draft, Lucas made heavy simplifications, and introduced the young hero on a farm as Luke Starkiller. Annikin became Luke's father, a wise Jedi knight. "The Force" was also introduced as a mystical energy field. The next draft removed the father character and replaced him with a substitute named Ben Kenobi, and in 1976 a fourth draft had been prepared for principal photography. The film was titled Adventures of Luke Starkiller, as taken from the Journal of the Whills, Saga I: The Star Wars. During production, Lucas changed Luke's name to Skywalker and altered the title to simply The Star Wars and finally Star Wars.[34]

John Williams, composer of the musical scores for all seven films of the original and prequel trilogies and Episode 7.
At that point, Lucas was not expecting the film to become part of a series. The fourth draft of the script underwent subtle changes that made it more satisfying as a self-contained film, ending with the destruction of the Galactic Empire itself by way of destroying the Death Star. However, Lucas had previously conceived of the film as the first in a series of adventures. Later, he realized the film would not in fact be the first in the sequence, but a film in the second trilogy in the saga. This is stated explicitly in George Lucas' preface to the 1994 reissue of Splinter of the Mind's Eye:
It wasn't long after I began writing Star Wars that I realized the story was more than a single film could hold. As the saga of the Skywalkers and Jedi Knights unfolded, I began to see it as a tale that could take at least nine films to tell—three trilogies—and I realized, in making my way through the back story and after story, that I was really setting out to write the middle story.
The second draft contained a teaser for a never-made sequel about "The Princess of Ondos", and by the time of the third draft some months later Lucas had negotiated a contract that gave him rights to make two sequels. Not long after, Lucas met with author Alan Dean Foster, and hired him to write these two sequels as novels.[35] The intention was that if Star Wars was successful, Lucas could adapt the novels into screenplays.[36] He had also by that point developed an elaborate backstory to aid his writing process.[37]
When Star Wars proved successful, Lucas decided to use the film as the basis for an elaborate serial, although at one point he considered walking away from the series altogether.[38] However, Lucas wanted to create an independent filmmaking center—what would become Skywalker Ranch—and saw an opportunity to use the series as a financing agent.[39] Alan Dean Foster had already begun writing the first sequel novel, but Lucas decided to abandon his plan to adapt Foster's work; the book was released as Splinter of the Mind's Eye the following year. At first, Lucas envisioned a series of films with no set number of entries, like the James Bond series. In an interview with Rolling Stone in August 1977, he said that he wanted his friends to each take a turn at directing the films and giving unique interpretations on the series. He also said that the backstory in which Darth Vader turns to the dark side, kills Luke's father and fights Ben Kenobi on a volcano as the Galactic Republic falls would make an excellent sequel.
Later that year, Lucas hired science fiction author Leigh Brackett to write Star Wars II with him. They held story conferences and, by late November 1977, Lucas had produced a handwritten treatment called The Empire Strikes Back. The treatment is similar to the final film, except that Darth Vader does not reveal he is Luke's father. In the first draft that Brackett would write from this, Luke's father appears as a ghost to instruct Luke.[40]
Brackett finished her first draft in early 1978; Lucas has said he was disappointed with it, but before he could discuss it with her, she died of cancer.[41] With no writer available, Lucas had to write his next draft himself. It was this draft in which Lucas first made use of the "Episode" numbering for the films; Empire Strikes Back was listed as Episode II.[42] As Michael Kaminski argues in The Secret History of Star Wars, the disappointment with the first draft probably made Lucas consider different directions in which to take the story.[43] He made use of a new plot twist: Darth Vader claims to be Luke's father. According to Lucas, he found this draft enjoyable to write, as opposed to the yearlong struggles writing the first film, and quickly wrote two more drafts,[44] both in April 1978. He also took the script to a darker extreme by having Han Solo imprisoned in carbonite and left in limbo.[27]
This new story point of Darth Vader being Luke's father had drastic effects on the series. Michael Kaminski argues in his book that it is unlikely that the plot point had ever seriously been considered or even conceived of before 1978, and that the first film was clearly operating under an alternate storyline where Vader was separate from Luke's father;[45] there is not a single reference to this plot point before 1978. After writing the second and third drafts of Empire Strikes Back in which the point was introduced, Lucas reviewed the new backstory he had created: Anakin Skywalker was Ben Kenobi's brilliant student and had a child named Luke, but was swayed to the dark side by Emperor Palpatine (who became a Sith and not simply a politician). Anakin battled Ben Kenobi on the site of a volcano and was wounded, but then resurrected as Darth Vader. Meanwhile, Kenobi hid Luke on Tatooine while the Republic became the Empire and Vader systematically hunted down and killed the Jedi.[46]
With this new backstory in place, Lucas decided that the series would be a trilogy, changing Empire Strikes Back from Episode II to Episode V in the next draft.[44]Lawrence Kasdan, who had just completed writing Raiders of the Lost Ark, was then hired to write the next drafts, and was given additional input from director Irvin Kershner. Kasdan, Kershner, and producer Gary Kurtz saw the film as a more serious and adult film, which was helped by the new, darker storyline, and developed the series from the light adventure roots of the first film.[47]
By the time he began writing Episode VI in 1981 (then titled Revenge of the Jedi), much had changed. Making Empire Strikes Back was stressful and costly, and Lucas' personal life was disintegrating. Burned out and not wanting to make any more Star Wars films, he vowed that he was done with the series in a May 1983 interview with Time magazine. Lucas' 1981 rough drafts had Darth Vader competing with the Emperor for possession of Luke—and in the second script, the "revised rough draft", Vader became a sympathetic character. Lawrence Kasdan was hired to take over once again and, in these final drafts, Vader was explicitly redeemed and finally unmasked. This change in character would provide a springboard to the "Tragedy of Darth Vader" storyline that underlies the prequels.[48]
Prequel trilogy
After losing much of his fortune in a divorce settlement in 1987, Lucas had no desire to return to Star Wars, and had unofficially canceled the sequel trilogy by the time of Return of the Jedi.[49] At that point, the prequels were only still a series of basic ideas partially pulled from his original drafts of "The Star Wars". Nevertheless, technical advances in the late 1980s and 1990s continued to fascinate Lucas, and he considered that they might make it possible to revisit his 20-year-old material. After Star Wars became popular once again, in the wake of Dark Horse's comic book line and Timothy Zahn's trilogy of novels, Lucas saw that there was still a large audience. His children were older, and with the explosion of CGI technology he was now considering returning to directing.[50] By 1993, it was announced, in Variety among other sources, that he would be making the prequels. He began penning more to the story, now indicating the series would be a tragic one examining Anakin Skywalker's fall to the dark side. Lucas also began to change how the prequels would exist relative to the originals; at first they were supposed to be a "filling-in" of history tangential to the originals, but now he saw that they could form the beginning of one long story that started with Anakin's childhood and ended with his death. This was the final step towards turning the film series into a "Saga".[51]
In 1994, Lucas began writing the screenplay to the first prequel, titled Episode I: The Beginning. Following the release of that film, Lucas announced that he would also be directing the next two, and began work on Episode II,[52] The first draft of Episode II was completed just weeks before principal photography, and Lucas hired Jonathan Hales, a writer from The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles, to polish it.[53] Unsure of a title, Lucas had jokingly called the film "Jar Jar's Great Adventure".[54] In writing The Empire Strikes Back, Lucas initially decided that Lando Calrissian was a clone and came from a planet of clones which caused the "Clone Wars" mentioned by Princess Leia in A New Hope;[55][56] he later came up with an alternate concept of an army of clone shocktroopers from a remote planet which attacked the Republic and were repelled by the Jedi.[57] The basic elements of that backstory became the plot basis for Episode II, with the new wrinkle added that Palpatine secretly orchestrated the crisis.[30]
Lucas began working on Episode III before Attack of the Clones was released, offering concept artists that the film would open with a montage of seven Clone War battles.[58] As he reviewed the storyline that summer, however, he says he radically re-organized the plot.[59] Michael Kaminski, in The Secret History of Star Wars, offers evidence that issues in Anakin's fall to the dark side prompted Lucas to make massive story changes, first revising the opening sequence to have Palpatine kidnapped and his apprentice, Count Dooku, murdered by Anakin as the first act in the latter's turn towards the dark side.[60] After principal photography was complete in 2003, Lucas made even more massive changes in Anakin's character, re-writing his entire turn to the dark side; he would now turn primarily in a quest to save Padmé's life, rather than the previous version in which that reason was one of several, including that he genuinely believed that the Jedi were evil and plotting to take over the Republic. This fundamental re-write was accomplished both through editing the principal footage, and new and revised scenes filmed during pick-ups in 2004.[61]
Lucas often exaggerated the amount of material he wrote for the series; much of it stemmed from the post?1978 period when the series grew into a phenomenon. Michael Kaminski explained that these exaggerations were both a publicity and security measure. Kaminski rationalized that since the series' story radically changed throughout the years, it was always Lucas' intention to change the original story retroactively because audiences would only view the material from his perspective.[31][62] When congratulating the producers of the TV series Lost in 2010, Lucas himself jokingly admitted, "when Star Wars first came out, I didn't know where it was going either. The trick is to pretend you've planned the whole thing out in advance. Throw in some father issues and references to other stories – let's call them homages – and you've got a series".[63]
Sequel trilogy
Main article: Star Wars sequel trilogy
A sequel trilogy was reportedly planned (Episodes VII, VIII and IX) by Lucasfilm as a sequel to the original Star Wars trilogy (Episodes IV, V and VI), released between 1977 and 1983.[64] While the similarly discussed Star Wars prequel trilogy (Episodes I, II and III) was ultimately released between 1999 and 2005, Lucasfilm and George Lucas had for many years denied plans for a sequel trilogy, insisting that Star Wars is meant to be a six-part series.[65][66] In May 2008, speaking about the upcoming Star Wars: The Clone Wars film, Lucas maintained his status on the sequel trilogy: "I get asked all the time, 'What happens after Return of the Jedi?,' and there really is no answer for that. The movies were the story of Anakin Skywalker and Luke Skywalker, and when Luke saves the galaxy and redeems his father, that's where that story ends."[67]
In January 2012, Lucas announced that he would step away from blockbuster films and instead produce smaller arthouse films. Asked whether the criticism he received following the prequel trilogy and the alterations to the original trilogy had influenced his decision to retire, Lucas said: "Why would I make any more when everybody yells at you all the time and says what a terrible person you are?"[68]
Despite insisting that a sequel trilogy would never happen, George Lucas began working on story treatments for three new Star Wars films in 2011. In October 2012, The Walt Disney Company agreed to buy Lucasfilm and announced that Star Wars Episode VII would be released in 2015. Later, it was revealed that the three new upcoming films (Episodes VII–IX) would be based on story treatments that had been written by George Lucas prior to the sale of Lucasfilm.[69] The co-chairman of Lucasfilm, Kathleen Kennedy became president of the company, reporting to Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan Horn. In addition, Kennedy will serve as executive producer on new Star Wars feature films, with franchise creator and Lucasfilm founder Lucas serving as creative consultant.[70] The screenplay for Episode VII was originally set to be written by Michael Arndt,[71] but in October 2013 it was announced that writing duties would be taken over by Lawrence Kasdan and J. J. Abrams.[72] On January 25, 2013, The Walt Disney Studios and Lucasfilm officially announced J. J. Abrams as Star Wars Episode VII's director and producer, along with Bryan Burk and Bad Robot Productions.[73]
On November 20, 2012, The Hollywood Reporter reported that Lawrence Kasdan and Simon Kinberg will write and produce Episodes VIII and IX.[74] Kasdan and Kinberg were later confirmed as creative consultants on those films, in addition to writing stand-alone films. In addition, John Williams, who wrote the music for the previous six episodes, has been hired to compose the music for Episodes VII, VIII and IX.[75]
On March 12, 2015, Lucasfilm announced that Looper director Rian Johnson would direct Episode VIII with Ram Bergman as producer for Ram Bergman Productions.[76] Reports initially claimed Johnson would also direct Episode IX, but it was later confirmed he would write only a story treatment.[77][78] When asked about Episode VIII in an August 2014 interview, Johnson said "it's boring to talk about, because the only thing I can really say is, I'm just happy. I don't have the terror I kind of expected I would, at least not yet. I'm sure I will at some point."[79] It was originally scheduled to be released on May 26, 2017, but it's delayed for December 15, 2017.[80][81] J. J. Abrams will serve as executive producer.[82]
Anthology series
On February 5, 2013, Disney CEO Bob Iger confirmed the development of two stand-alone films, each individually written by Lawrence Kasdan and Simon Kinberg.[83] On February 6, Entertainment Weekly reported that Disney is working on two films featuring Han Solo and Boba Fett.[84] Disney CFO Jay Rasulo has described the stand-alone films as origin stories.[85] Kathleen Kennedy explained that the stand-alone films will not crossover with the films of the sequel trilogy, stating, "George was so clear as to how that works. The canon that he created was the Star Wars saga. Right now, Episode VII falls within that canon. The spin-off movies, or we may come up with some other way to call those films, they exist within that vast universe that he created. There is no attempt being made to carry characters (from the stand-alone films) in and out of the saga episodes. Consequently, from the creative standpoint, it's a roadmap that George made pretty clear."[86] In April 2015, Lucasfilm and Kathleen Kennedy announced that the stand-alone films would be referred to as the Star Wars Anthology series.[87][88]
Rogue One
Main article: Rogue One
In May 2014, Lucasfilm announced that Gareth Edwards would direct the first anthology film, to be released on December 16, 2016, with Gary Whitta writing the first draft.[89] On March 12, 2015, the film's title was revealed to be Rogue One with Chris Weitz rewriting the script, with Felicity Jones, Ben Mendelsohn and Diego Lunastarring.[90][91] On April 19, 2015, a teaser trailer was shown exclusively during the closing of the Star Wars Celebration. Lucasfilm also announced that filming would begin in the summer of 2015. The plot will revolve around a group of rebels on a mission to steal the Death Star plans; director Edwards stated, "It comes down to a group of individuals who don't have magical powers that have to somehow bring hope to the galaxy." Additionally, Kathleen Kennedy and Kiri Hart confirmed that the stand-alone films will be labeled as "anthology films". Edwards stated that the style of the film will be similar to that of a war film, stating, "It's the reality of war. Good guys are bad. Bad guys are good. It's complicated, layered; a very rich scenario in which to set a movie."[92][93]
Untitled Han Solo Anthology film
On July 7, 2015, Lucasfilm announced, via StarWars.com, that a second Anthology film, which "focuses on how young Han Solo became the smuggler, thief, and scoundrel whom Luke Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi first encountered in the cantina at Mos Eisley",[94] would be released on May 25, 2018. The project will be directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller from a script by Lawrence and Jon Kasdan. Kathleen Kennedy will produce the film, Lawrence Kasdan and Jason McGatlin will executive produce, and Will Allegra will co-produce.[95] The Hollywood Reporter stated when reporting the story, that the film is separate to the film that was originally being developed by Josh Trank. That film has now been pushed back to an unconfirmed date.[1] The Wrap reported that Chewbacca will appear.[96]On May 5, 2016, Deadline reported that Alden Ehrenreich was cast as young Han Solo in the film.[97][98] Kasdan has stated that filming will start in January 2017.[99]In September 2016, Bradford Young was announced as the cinematographer for the film.[100] In October 2016, Donald Glover was cast to play a young Lando Calrissian.[101]
Untitled Anthology film
A third Anthology film will be released in 2020.[102] A writer for the film has been hired as of September 2016.[103]
3D releases
At a ShoWest convention in 2005, Lucas demonstrated new technology and stated that he planned to release the six films in a new 3D film format, beginning with A New Hope in 2007.[104] However, by January 2007, Lucasfilm stated on StarWars.com that "there are no definitive plans or dates for releasing the Star Wars saga in 3-D." At Celebration Europe in July 2007, Rick McCallum confirmed that Lucasfilm was "planning to take all six films and turn them into 3-D", but they are "waiting for the companies out there that are developing this technology to bring it down to a cost level that makes it worthwhile for everybody".[105] In July 2008, Jeffrey Katzenberg, the CEO of DreamWorks Animation, revealed that Lucas planned to redo all six of the movies in 3D.[106] In late September 2010, it was announced that The Phantom Menace would be theatrically re-released in 3-D on February 10, 2012.[107][108] The plan was to re-release all six films in order, with the 3-D conversion process taking up to a year to complete for each film.[109] However, the 3D re-releases of episodes II and III were postponed to enable Lucasfilm to concentrate on Episode VII.[110]

All seven films of the Star Wars series were shot in an aspect ratio of 2.39:1. The original and sequel trilogies were shot with anamorphic lenses. Episodes IV, V, and VII were shot in Panavision, while Episode VI was shot in Joe Dunton Camera (JDC) scope. Episode I was shot with Hawk anamorphic lenses on Arriflexcameras, and Episodes II and III were shot with Sony's CineAlta high-definition digital cameras.[119]
Lucas hired Ben Burtt to oversee the sound effects on the original 1977 film. Burtt's accomplishment was such that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences presented him with a Special Achievement Award because it had no award at the time for the work he had done.[120] Lucasfilm developed the THX sound reproduction standard for Return of the Jedi.[121] John Williams composed the scores for all seven films. Lucas' design for Star Wars involved a grand musical sound, with leitmotifs for different characters and important concepts. Williams' Star Wars title theme has become one of the most famous and well-known musical compositions in modern music history.[122]
Lucas hired 'the Dean of Special Effects' John Stears, who created R2-D2, Luke Skywalker's Landspeeder, the Jedi Knights' lightsabers, and the Death Star.[123][124]The technical lightsaber choreography for the original trilogy was developed by leading filmmaking sword-master Bob Anderson. Anderson trained actor Mark Hamill(Luke Skywalker) and performed all the sword stunts as Darth Vader during the lightsaber duels in The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, wearing Vader's costume. Anderson's role in the original Star Wars trilogy was highlighted in the film Reclaiming the Blade, where he shares his experiences as the fight choreographer developing the lightsaber techniques for the movies.[125]

Aside from its well known science fictional technology, Star Wars features elements such as knighthood, chivalry, and princesses that are related to archetypes of the fantasy genre.[151] The Star Wars world, unlike fantasy and science-fiction films that featured sleek and futuristic settings, was portrayed as dirty and grimy. Lucas' vision of a "used future" was further popularized in the science fiction-horror films Alien,[152] which was set on a dirty space freighter; Mad Max 2, which is set in a post-apocalyptic desert; and Blade Runner, which is set in a crumbling, dirty city of the future. Lucas made a conscious effort to parallel scenes and dialogue between films, and especially to parallel the journeys of Luke Skywalker with that of his father Anakin when making the prequels.[29]
Historical inspirations and comparisons
See also: Star Wars sources and analogues
Star Wars contains many themes of political science that mainly favor democracy over dictatorship. Political science has been an important element of Star Warssince the franchise first launched in 1977. The plot climax of Revenge of the Sith is modeled after the fall of the democratic Roman Republic and the formation of an empire.[153][154][155]
The stormtroopers from the movies share a name with the Nazi stormtroopers (see also Sturmabteilung). Imperial officers' uniforms also resemble some historical German Army uniforms (see Wehrmacht) and the political and security officers of the Empire resemble the black clad SS down to the imitation silver death's head insignia on their officer's caps. World War II terms were used for names in Star Wars; examples include the planets Kessel (a term that refers to a group of encircled forces), Hoth (Hermann Hoth was a German general who served on the snow laden Eastern Front), and Tatooine (Tataouine - a province south of Tunis in Tunisia, roughly where Lucas filmed for the planet; Libya was a WWII arena of war).[156] Palpatine being Chancellor before becoming Emperor mirrors Adolf Hitler's role as Chancellor before appointing himself Dictator. The Great Jedi Purge alludes to the events of The Holocaust, the Great Purge, the Cultural Revolution, and the Night of the Long Knives. In addition, Lucas himself has drawn parallels between Palpatine and his rise to power to historical dictators such as Julius Caesar, Napoleon Bonaparte, and Adolf Hitler. The final medal awarding scene in A New Hope, however, references Leni Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will.[157] The space battles in A New Hope were based on filmed World War I and World War II dogfights.[158]
Continuing the use of Nazi inspiration for the Empire, J. J. Abrams, the director of Star Wars: The Force Awakens, has said that the First Order, an Imperial offshoot which will possibly serve as the main antagonist of the sequel trilogy, is also inspired by another aspect of the Nazi regime. Abrams spoke of how several Nazis fled to Argentina after the war and he claims that the concept for the First Order came from conversations between the scriptwriters about what would have happened if they had started working together again.[159]
In other media
Main articles: Star Wars canon and Star Wars expanded universe
The term Expanded Universe (EU) is an umbrella term for officially licensed Star Wars material outside of the feature films. The material expands the stories told in the films, taking place anywhere from 25,000 years before The Phantom Menace to 140 years after Return of the Jedi.
While Lucasfilm strived to maintain internal consistency between the films and television content with the expanded universe, only the films and the second Clone Wars television series are regarded as absolute canon, since Lucas worked on them directly. On April 25, 2014—anticipating future film installments—the company announced that they had devised a "story group" to oversee and co-ordinate all creative development. The first new on-screen canon to be produced will be the television series Star Wars Rebels. Previous EU titles will be reprinted under the "Legends" banner.[160] In addition, Lucasfilm Licensing and the new Lucasfilm Story Group devote efforts to ensure continuity between the works of various authors across companies.[161]
Television
Films
Three films were produced for television.

Cosplay of the Star Warscharacter, Boba Fett. The popular character was first incorporated in the Expanded Universe in the television film Star Wars Holiday Specialuntil appearing in the main film series.[162]
* Star Wars Holiday Special (1978) is a 2-hour television special, broadcast once on CBS and never released to home video. Set between the original Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back, it focuses on Chewbacca visiting his family in time to celebrate the "Life Day". The special was critically panned, and Lucas is said to regret its production. However, an animated segment introducing Boba Fett was well-received and described as its highlight. The special became a cult classic, and bootleg recordings have been shared or sold among fans at conventions and later through digital file sharing.[163]
* Caravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure (1984), is a made-for-TV film, released theatrically in Europe. Set before Return of the Jedi, the film follows the Ewoks and a family whose ship crashes on Endor.[164]
* Ewoks: The Battle for Endor (1985) is a made-for-TV film released theatrically in Europe. A sequel to the Caravan of Courage, the film depicts the Ewoks' defending Endor from mauraders.[165]
Animated series
Following the success of the Star Wars films and their subsequent merchandising, several animated television series have been created: Several Star Wars animated series have been produced.
* Star Wars: Droids (1985-1986), also known as Droids: The Adventures of R2-D2 and C-3PO, that aired on ABC. Set between the events of Episode III and Episode IV, the series focuses on the travels of R2-D2 and C-3PO as they shift through various owners.[166][167]
* Star Wars: Ewoks (1985-1986) focused on the adventures of Wicket and various other recognizable Ewok characters from Return of the Jedi in the years leading up to the film.[168] It was simultaneously released with Droids.
* Star Wars: Clone Wars (2003-2005) is an animated micro-series created by Genndy Tartakovsky depicting events between Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith. The series introduced General Grievous before his theatrical appearance.[169] The series won three Emmy Awards, including the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program.[170][171]
* Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008-2014) is a CGI-animated series, also set between Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith; related to the animated film of the same name. The series aired on Cartoon Network for five seasons, and its sixth and final season was released through Netflix.[172] The series was cancelled following the Disney acquisition, and its unproduced storylines were adapted as novels and comics.[173][174]
* Star Wars Rebels (2014–present) is a CGI-animated series currently airing on Disney XD. Set between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope, the series follows a band of rebels as they fight the Galactic Empire.[175][176]
Future:
* Star Wars Detours is an unreleased animated comedy series written by Brendan Hay with creative consulting from Seth Green and Matthew Senreich. The series was intended to take place during the original trilogy and the set remotely from the front line of war.[177] Following the Disney purchase, the series was put on indefinite hold, though 39 episodes were completed.
In September 2016, Lucasfilm announced that Dave Filoni supervising director of The Clone Wars and Rebels, was promoted to oversee the development of all future Lucasfilm Animation projects. He remained producer of Rebels, but left his role as supervising director of Rebels for Season 3 to have more time to develop such new projects.[178]
Live-action series
A live-action television project has been in varying stages of development at Lucasfilm since 2005, when George Lucas announced plans for a television series set between the prequel and original trilogies.[179] The proposed series explores criminal and political power struggles in the aftermath of the fall of the Republic. Approximately fifty scripts have been written – Ronald D. Moore was one of the project's enlisted writers[179] – and, as of December 2015, are still in possible development at Lucasfilm.[180]

Star Wars-based fiction predates the release of the first film, with the 1976 novelization of Star Wars (ghost-written by Alan Dean Foster and credited to Lucas). The first Expanded Universe story appeared in Marvel Comics' Star Wars #7 in January 1978 (the first six issues of the series having been an adaptation of the film), followed quickly by Alan Dean Foster's novel Splinter of the Mind's Eye the following month.[181]
Novels
Main article: List of Star Wars novels
Foster's 1978 novel, Splinter of the Mind's Eye, was the first Expanded Universe work to be released. In addition to filling in the time between the original 1977 film and The Empire Strikes Back, this additional content greatly expanded the Star Wars timeline before and after the film series. Star Wars fiction flourished during the time of the original trilogy (1977–1983) but slowed to a trickle afterwards. In the 90's Star Wars novels sparked new interest in the franchise, mainly because of the debut of Timothy Zahn's Thrawn trilogy (1992-1994), but also ignited by Steve Perry's novel Shadows of the Empire (1996), set in between The Empire Strikes Backand Return of the Jedi, and accompanying video game and comic book series.[182] Since then, several hundred tie-in novels have been published by Bantam and Del Rey.
LucasBooks changed the face of the Star Wars universe with the introduction of the New Jedi Order series, which took place 20 years after Return of the Jedifocusing on a host of new characters alongside series originals. During that time three series were introduced for younger audiences, the Jedi Apprentice told adventures of Obi-Wan Kenobi and his master Qui-Gon Jinn in the years before The Phantom Menace. While The Jedi Quest followed Obi-Wan as the master of Anakin Skywalker in between The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones. The Last of the Jedi was about Obi-Wan and the last few surviving Jedi set almost immediately afterRevenge of the Sith.
Following Disney's purchase of the franchise, Disney Publishing Worldwide also announced that Del Rey would publish a new line of canon Star Wars books under the Lucasfilm Story Group being released starting in September on a bi-monthly schedule.[183] The Star Wars Legends banner would be used for those Extended Universe materials that are in print.[184]
George Lucas adopted elements from the novels in the films, such as the name of capital planet Coruscant, in The Phantom Menace, while Dave Filoni adopted the villain character of Grand Admiral Thrawn in Star Wars Rebels, both first appeared in Timothy Zahn's Thrawn Trilogy of novels.
Comics
Main articles: Star Wars (comics) and List of Star Wars comic books
Marvel Comics published Star Wars comic book series and adaptations from 1977 to 1986. A wide variety of creators worked on this series, including Roy Thomas, Archie Goodwin, Howard Chaykin, Al Williamson, Carmine Infantino, Gene Day, Walt Simonson, Michael Golden, Chris Claremont, Whilce Portacio, Jo Duffy, and Ron Frenz. The Los Angeles Times Syndicate published a Star Wars newspaper strip by Russ Manning, Goodwin and Williamson[185][186] with Goodwin writing under a pseudonym. In the late 1980s, Marvel announced it would publish a new Star Wars comic by Tom Veitch and Cam Kennedy. However, in December 1991, Dark Horse Comics acquired the Star Wars license, and used it to publish a large number of original adventures set in the Star Wars universe, varying from ambitious sequels to the original trilogy like the popular Dark Empire,[187] to parody comics, like Tag and Bink.[188] On January 3, 2014, Marvel Comics —itself a Disney subsidiary since 2009— reclaimed from Dark Horse, the publishing rights toStar Wars with the first release arriving on January 14, 2015. All previously published works were re-branded as Legends.[189]
George Lucas adopted elements from the comics in the films, such as the character Aayla Secura, who was introduced in Dark Horse Comics' Star Wars series, Lucas liked the character so much, that he included her in Attack of the Clones.[190]
Video games
Main articles: Star Wars video games and List of Star Wars video games
Star Wars videogames commercialization started in 1982 with Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back published for the Atari 2600 by Parker Brothers. Since then, Star Wars has opened the way to a myriad of space-flight simulation games, first-person shooter games, role-playing video games, RTS games, and others released on all consoles including PS3, PSP, PS2, Xbox 360, Nintendo DS, Wii, and the current Xbox One and PlayStation 4.
The most critically acclaimed is the first game in the Knights of the Old Republic series,[191] whom focuses on the Jedi Order 4000 years before the films. Star Wars: The Force Unleashed and it's sequel focused on Darth Vader's "secret apprentice" hunting down the remaining Jedi, 3 years before A New Hope, also proved popular among fans, they released[192][193] for the PS3, Xbox 360, with ports for the other consoles.
The best-selling games so far are the Lego Star Wars and the Battlefront series, with 12 million and 10 million units respectively[194][195] both have recent installments. The Battlefront series focuses on recreating the wars depicted on the films, while The Lego Star Wars series recreates: The Original 6 films, The Clone Wars, and The Force Awakens on LEGO.
Disney Infinity 3.0, released on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Wii U, iOS, PC, Xbox One and PlayStation 4 in 2015, featuring characters from the Star Wars universe.[196]
In 2014, as with the books and comics all previous games became re-branded as Legends. Since Lucas Arts closed, the license was acquired by EA games, with Jade Raymond, and Amy Hennig heading the development of the upcoming games, that will be part of the cannon.[197][198]
Radio
A radio adaptation of the original 1977 film written by science fiction author Brian Daley and directed by John Madden was first broadcast on National Public Radio in 1981, followed by adaptations of The Empire Strikes Back(1983) and Return of the Jedi(1996). Mark Hamill, Billy Dee Williams, reprised their roles from the films for the first two, while Anthony Daniels in all adaptations. It used John Williams' original score from the films and Ben Burtt's original sound designs. Background material created by Lucas but not used in the films as included.[199][200]
Action figures, LEGO, board games, trading cards, and role-playing games
Main articles: Kenner Star Wars action figures, List of Kenner Star Wars action figures, Star Wars: The Vintage Collection, Lego Star Wars, and List of Lego Star Wars sets
Main articles: Star Wars trading card and Star Wars role-playing games
Kenner made the first Star Wars action figures to coincide with the release of the film, and today the remaining 80's figures sell at extremely high prices in auctions. Since the 90's Hasbro holds the rights to create action figures based on the saga. Pez dispensers have been produced.
Star Wars was the first intellectual property to be licensed in Lego Group history, which has produced a Star Wars Lego theme.[201] Lego has produced animated parody short films to promote their sets, among them Revenge of the Brick (2005) and The Quest for R2-D2 (2009), the former parodies Revenge of the Sith, while the later The Clone Wars film. Due to their success, LEGO created animated comedy mini-series among them The Yoda Chronicles (2013-2014) and Droid Tales(2015) originally airing on Cartoon Network, but since 2014 moved into Disney XD.[202] The Lego Star Wars video games are critically acclaimed best sellers.
In 1977 with the board game Star Wars: Escape from the Death Star[203] (not to be confused with another board game with the same title, published in 1990).[204]The board game Risk has been adapted to the series in two editions by Hasbro: and Star Wars Risk: The Clone Wars Edition[205] (2005) and Risk: Star Wars Original Trilogy Edition[206] (2006).
Three different official tabletop role-playing games have been developed for the Star Wars universe: a version by West End Games in the 1980s and 1990s, one by Wizards of the Coast in the 2000s and one by Fantasy Flight Games in the 2010s.
Star Wars trading cards have been published since the first "blue" series, by Topps, in 1977.[207] Dozens of series have been produced, with Topps being the licensed creator in the United States. Some of the card series are of film stills, while others are original art. Many of the cards have become highly collectible with some very rare "promos", such as the 1993 Galaxy Series II "floating Yoda" P3 card often commanding US$1?000 or more. While most "base" or "common card" sets are plentiful, many "insert" or "chase cards" are very rare.[208] From 1995 until 2001, Decipher, Inc. had the license for, created and produced a collectible card game based on Star Wars; the Star Wars Collectible Card Game (also known as SWCCG).
Theme park attractions

The original Star Tours ride at Disneyland in 1996.
Star Tours and Star Tours – The Adventures Continue
Before Disney's acquisition of the franchise, George Lucas had established a partnership in 1986 with the company's Walt Disney Imagineering division to create Star Tours, an attraction that opened at Disneyland in 1987. The attraction also had subsequent incarnations at other Disney theme parks worldwide.[209][210]
The attractions at Disneyland and Disney's Hollywood Studios closed in 2010, at Tokyo Disneyland in 2012, and at Disneyland Paris in 2016 to allow the rides to be updated into Star Tours–The Adventures Continue. The new attraction randomly shuffles a number of scenes, allowing for the equivalent of 54 different adventures for visitors to experience. The successor attraction opened at Disney's Hollywood Studios and Disneyland in 2011, and Tokyo Disneyland in 2013.[211]
Live attractions
Jedi Training: Trials of the Temple is a live show where children are selected to learn the teachings of the Jedi Knights and the Force to become Padawan learners. The show is present at Disney's Hollywood Studios and at the Tomorrowland Terrace at Disneyland. The two parks hosted a seasonal Star Wars-themed event entitled Season of the Force, with Disneyland's version beginning in November 16, 2015. The event featured the debut of a new scene in Star Tours–The Adventures Continue set on Jakku, Star Wars Launch Bay, an attraction featuring exhibits and meet-and-greets, and a seasonal overlay for Space Mountain entitled "Hyperspace Mountain" for Disneyland.
From 1997 to 2015, Walt Disney World's Disney's Hollywood Studios park hosted an annual festival, Star Wars Weekends, during specific dates from May to June.
Star Wars Land
Since August 2014, after Disney acquired the Star Wars franchise, the company expressed plans to expand the franchise's presence in all of their theme parks, which was rumored to include a major Star Wars-themed expansion to Disney's Hollywood Studios.[212] When asked whether or not Disney has an intellectual property franchise that's comparable to Harry Potter at Universal theme parks, Disney chairman and CEO Bob Iger mentioned Cars and the Disney Princesses, and promised that Star Wars, "is going to be just that."[213] Iger formally announced a 14-acre Star Wars-themed land expansion at the D23 Expo in August 2015. The land—which will debut at Disneyland and Disney's Hollywood Studios at an unspecified date—will include two new attractions inspired by the Millennium Falcon and "a climactic battle between the First Order and the resistance".[214]
Cultural impact


Just like the franchise, its fictional weapons contained in it, such as the lightsaber and the blaster, have been used in popular culture and have been an iconic part of the franchise..
Main article: Cultural impact of Star Wars
The Star Wars saga has had a significant impact on modern popular culture.[215] Star Wars references are deeply embedded in popular culture;[216] Phrases like "evil empire" and "May the Force be with you" have become part of the popular lexicon.[217]The first Star Wars film in 1977 was a cultural unifier,[218] enjoyed by a wide spectrum of people.[219] The film can be said to have helped launch the science fiction boom of the late 1970s and early 1980s, making science fiction films a blockbuster genre or mainstream.[220] This very impact also made it a prime target for parody works and homages, with popular examples including Spaceballs, Family Guy's "Blue Harvest" special, Seth Green's "Robot Chicken: Star Wars", and "Hardware Wars" by Ernie Fosselius, which Lucas himself has called "a cute little film".[221]
In 1989, the Library of Congress selected the original Star Wars film for preservation in the U.S. National Film Registry, as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant."[222] Its sequel, The Empire Strikes Back, was selected in 2010.[223][224]Despite these callings for archival, it is unclear whether copies of the 1977 and 1980 theatrical sequences of Star Wars and Empire—or copies of the 1997 Special Edition versions—have been archived by the NFR, or indeed if any copy has been provided by Lucasfilm and accepted by the Registry.[225][226]
Fan works
Main article: Star Wars fan films
The Star Wars saga has inspired many fans to create their own non-canon material set in the Star Wars galaxy. In recent years, this has ranged from writing fan-fiction to creating fan films. In 2002, Lucasfilm sponsored the first annual Official Star Wars Fan Film Awards, officially recognizing filmmakers and the genre. Because of concerns over potential copyright and trademark issues, however, the contest was initially open only to parodies, mockumentaries, and documentaries. Fan-fiction films set in the Star Wars universe were originally ineligible, but in 2007 Lucasfilm changed the submission standards to allow in-universe fiction entries.[227] Lucasfilm, for the most part, has allowed but not endorsed the creation of these derivative fan-fiction works, so long as no such work attempts to make a profit from or tarnish the Star Wars franchise in any way.[228] While many fan films have used elements from the licensed Expanded Universe to tell their story, they are not considered an official part of the Star Wars canon.
